TI CEMENT WITH INTERGROUND ADDITIVES - CAPABILITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   RELIEF .1.
SO ZEMENT-KALK-GIPS
LA German
DT Article
AB The preparation of a European cement standard formed the stimulus in Germany for extending the range of different cements described in DIN 1164 to cover new cements with interground additives which have proved successful in other countries over a period of many years.  These are primarily portland limestone cement and cements containing fly-ash from coal.  They make it possible for the capabilities of the cement to be adapted more individually to the requirements of the cement consumer and building user, which vary quite considerably depending on the area of application.  According to extensive tests - covering strengths and durability characteristics in concrete including resistance to frost and de-icing salts - cements with interground additives are at least equivalent to the locally comparable standard cements from the point of view of construction technology.  This is true provided that the interground additives are selected carefully and are submitted to quality control, and provided that suitable manufacturing precautions are observed.  They must be used in accordance with the relevant approval of the German Institute of Construction Technology and can be used in virtually all areas of application.  Portland limestone cements often produce concretes with particularly favourable workability characteristics.  The use of granulated blastfurnace slag, suitable coal fly-ash, or other pozzolanic or latent hydraulic substances, and the intergrinding of limestone makes it possible to lower the consumption of natural raw materials, to conserve landfill space and to save fuel energy for clinker production, and hence also to make appreciable reductions in the emission of CO2.  This achieves another significant contribution towards lessening the burden on the environment during cement production.

TI DISTRICT-HEATING SYSTEMS AND ENERGY-CONSERVATION .2.
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of energy conservation between 1978 and 2010 on the utilization of existing and future district-heat production for a Swedish district-heating system are analyzed employing an end-use approach. The energy-conservation potential for space and water heating is calculated to be 35-40% of the final energy use in buildings located in the geographical area of the district-heating system and constructed before 1978. Based on results between 1978 and 1987, the estimated ratio between implemented measures and the calculated conservation potential is 75%. Energy conservation increases the ratio between the annual produced district heat and the design heat load. The connection of additional buildings to the district-heating system will compensate for energy conservation and result in a constant district-heat load and nearly constant marginal operating costs with efficient utilization of existing and future district-heat production. Cogeneration with biomass and energy conservation will together strongly reduce CO2 emissions, compared with a production system based on fossil fuels and without energy conservation.

AB Representative data is used to describe the mass and energy flows and cal bon dioxide emissions during the manufacture of rime and limestone products. The evaluation includes not only the flows directly involved but also tile primary energy and material inputs which occur when tracing the system back to the sources of raw material and primary energy. The balance boundaries are chosen so that individual stages in tile manufacturing process can be examined first, and then these can befitted together like building blocks to form product manufacturing lines or: for example, a lime works by extending the area covered by the balance. All the partial processes, starting from excavation and covering the manufacturing process, are included quantitatively in the balance in respect of energy expenditure, raw materials expenditure and carbon dioxide emissions produced, i.e. the cumulative energy and material inputs and cumulative CO2 emission are determined for each case. Characteristic numbers are defined for assessing the products or process stages. The procedure described above is illustrated with the aid of an example and then carried out for all the manufacturing steps under consideration.

AB In view of the necessity to decrease the energy consumption world-wide - especially of the industrial nations - the energy supply enterprises, in particular, are requested to find new solution formulations to an environmentally acceptable energy supply. the municipal works in Hanover have developed a sequence of pilot projects and measures which serve this objective. Among these are energetic reorganization of existing buildings within the framework of the thermics programme of the EU, the proof that the energy demand of the new houses can be economically limited by a low energy house programme of about 50kWh/m(2), the suggestion to save LP up to 40 MW of the electricity demand, the erection of a housing estate for the EXPO 2000 producing only 40% of the at present usual CO2 emissions of modern residential areas.

AB Active sub-slab depressurization (SSD) systems are an effective means of reducing indoor radon concentrations in residential buildings. However, energy is required to operate the system fan and to heat or cool the resulting increased building ventilation. We present regional and national estimates of the energy requirements, operating expenses and CO2 emissions associated with using SSD systems at saturation (i.e. in all US homes with radon concentrations above the EPA remediation guideline and either basement or slab-on-grade construction). The primary source of uncertainty in these estimates is the impact of the SSD system on house ventilation rate. Overall, individual SSD system operating expenses are highest in the Northeast and Midwest at about $99 y(-1), and lowest in the South and West at about $66 y(-1). The fan consumes, on average, about 40% of the end-use energy used to operate the SSD system and accounts for about 60% of the annual expense. At saturation, regional impacts are largest in the Midwest because this area has a large number of mitigable houses and a relatively high heating load. We estimate that operating SSD systems in US houses, where it is both appropriate and possible (about 2.6 million houses), will annually consume 1.7 x 10(4) (6.4 x 10(3) to 3.9 x 10(4)) TJ of end-use energy, cost $230 (130 to 400) million (at current energy prices), and generate 2.0 x 10(9) (1.2 x 10(9) to 3.5 x 10(9)) kg of CO2. Passive or energy efficient radon mitigation systems currently being developed offer opportunities to substantially reduce these impacts.

ID SEASONAL STORAGE; ENERGY-CONSERVATION; BUILDINGS; HELLAS
AB Actual energy and environmental problems call for an increase of the use of solar energy. In Greece, though solar domestic hot water (DHW) systems are very popular, active solar space heating remains marginal, mainly because of the lack of experience of building professionals. Central solar heating plants with seasonal storage (CSHPSS) are promising systems. In this article, the design data of an interseasonal storage system in Greece are compared with the results of two CSHPSS simulation software codes, MINSUN and SOLCHIPS. The comparison showed good agreement and therefore these user-friendly tools can be used with confidence for the design of CSHPSS under Creek weather conditions. SOLCHIPS was used in order to assess the technical and economic feasibility of three generic types of CSHPSS under four climatically different Greek locations. The results show that CSHPSS, mainly used until now in northern countries, is also an interesting solution for southern climates. With the high solar fractions that CSHPSS achieve, their use can further reduce not only the conventional energy consumption of buildings, but also the associated CO2 emissions that contribute significantly to the already heavy pollution of Greek urban areas.

AB The effects on the external environment of seven concrete and steel building frames representative of present-day building technology in Sweden were analysed using LCA methodology. Obiects of the study included frame construction and supplememary materials. Several-storey offices and dwellings were studied. The functional unit was defined as one average m(2) of floor area during the lifetime of the building. Inventory data were elaborated for concrete and steel production, the building site, service life, demolition and final disposal. Parameters included were raw material use, energy use, emissions to air, emissions to water and waste generation. The inventory results were presented and evaluated as such, in addition to an interpretation by using three quantitative impact assessment methods. Parameters that weighed heavily were use of fossil fuels, CO2, electricity, SOx, NOx, alloy materials and waste, depending on what assessment method was used. Over the life cycle, building production from cradle to gate accounted for about the same contribution to total environmental loads as maintenance and replacement of heat losses through external walls during service life, whereas demolition and final disposal accounted for a considerably lower contribution.

TI Carbon dioxide emissions in OECD service sectors: the critical role of
   electricity use
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE carbon-dioxide emission; service sector; energy-efficiency
AB From the early 1970s to mid 1990s, service sector CO2 emissions have increased significantly in OECD countries, despite marked declines in energy intensity. This development is underscored by a widespread shift from fuel use to electricity use in commercial buildings. Service sectors in countries that produce low-carbon electricity, particularly those that operate nuclear- and hydro-powered utilities, have most successfully restrained CO2 emissions. This study analyzes the impact of activity, structure, energy intensity, fuel mix, and utility mix on carbon emissions in the service sector for 13 OECD countries, and contrasts the developments before 1990 with those afterwards. The major findings of this analysis are:
   (i) Carbon emissions, which rose in 9 of the 13 countries investigated, were bolstered in every country by an expansion of floor area and service sector GDP,
   (ii) Declines in energy intensity and carbon intensity lessened the magnitude of emissions increases,
   (iii) Electricity's share of final energy use rose in all 13 countries, but affected carbon emissions quite differently among countries,
   (iv) After 1990, energy intensity improvements applied less downward pressure on emissions, while reductions in the average carbon content of final energy restrained emissions more strongly. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB About two-thirds of primary energy today is used directly as transportation and heating fuels. Any discussion of energy-related issues, such as air pollution, global climate change, and energy supply security, raises the issue of future use of alternative fuels. Hydrogen offers large potential benefits in terms of reduced emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases and diversified primary energy supply. Like electricity, hydrogen is a premium-quality energy carrier, which can be used with high efficiency and zero emissions. Hydrogen can be made from a variety of feedstocks, including natural gas, coal, biomass, wastes, solar sources, wind, or nuclear sources. Hydrogen vehicles, heating, and power systems have been technically demonstrated. Key hydrogen end-use technologies such as fuel cells are making rapid progress toward commercialization. If hydrogen were made from renewable or decarbonized fossil sources, it would be possible to have a large-scale energy system with essentially no emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases. Despite these potential benefits, the development of a large-scale hydrogen energy infrastructure is often seen as an insurmountable technical and economic barrier. Here we review the current status of technologies for hydrogen production, storage, transmission, and distribution; describe likely areas for technological progress; and discuss the implications for developing hydrogen as an energy carrier.

DE pollution; backstop; limit cycles
ID LIMIT-CYCLES
AB This paper considers an economy using a technology that adds to a stuck of pollution. Examples that come to mind are SO-emissions from burning coal accumulating in the soil and CO2-emissions from fossil-energy use which art: retained in the atmosphere. The stock of pollutants is subject to natural decay. albeit not necessarily of the simple often assumed linear type. In addition, a clean or so-called backstop technology is available that requires costly investments but is: characterized by low variable costs (e.g., solar energy or wind power). The costly investments imply a slow build-up of the capacity of the backstop, On the modelling side. this is an essential extension of most of the literature that considers the: unrealistic case where a backstop is instantaneously available. The second extension the present paper makes is to consider not only the planning problem but also the competitive outcomes. One of the interesting results is that stable limit cycles may characterize the socially optimal long-run outcome as well as the competitive equilibrium. Ln a competitive equilibrium pollution-control policy is not necessarily optimal in the sense of corresponding with the social optimum. Although cycling can occur in a competitive equilibrium just as: in the social optimum, relaxation of the control increases the set of parameter values for which complex and unstable behavior arises.

AB In this paper, primary energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from the construction of a multi-storey building, with either a wood or a concrete frame, were calculated from life-cycle and forest land-use perspectives. The primary energy input (mainly fossil fuels) in the production of building materials was found to be about 60-80% higher when concrete frames were considered instead of wood frames. The net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for wood materials will depend strongly on how the wood is handled after demolition of the building. The net GHG balance will be slightly positive if all the demolition wood is used to replace fossil fuels, slightly negative if part of the demolition wood is re-used, and clearly positive if all wood is deposited in landfills, due to the production of CH4. However, if the biogas produced is collected and used to replace fossil fuels, the net GHG emissions will be insignificant. If concrete frames are used, the net GHG emissions will be about those when demolition wood from the wood-framed building is deposited in landfills and no biogas is collected. We have considered that the CO2 released from the chemical processes in the production of cement will be re-bound to the concrete by the carbonisation process. Otherwise, the net GHG emission would be more than twice as high when concrete frames are used. If forest biomass is used instead of fossil fuels, the net area of forest land required to supply both raw material and energy for the production of building materials, will be about twice as high when wood frames are used instead of concrete frames. However, the GHG mitigation efficiency, expressed as CO, equivalents per unit area of forest land, will be 2-3 times higher when wood frames are used if excess wood waste and logging residues are used to replace fossil fuels. The excess forest in the: concrete frame alternative is used to replace fossil fuels, but if this forest is used for carbon storage, the mitigation efficiency will be higher for the first forest rotation period (100 yr), but lower for the following rotation periods. Some of the data used in the analyses are uncertain, but an understanding of the complexity in comparing different alternatives for utilising forest for GHG mitigation, and of the fact that the time perspective applied affects the results markedly, is more important for the results than the precise figures in the input data.

   energy efficiency; offices; regulations; sustainability; UK
AB The rate of growth in UK commercial energy consumption since the early 1970s has been approximately three times greater than in the domestic sector. Consumption is projected to continue growing faster than in all other sectors except transport. Increasing floor space has been accompanied by rising energy intensity in many commercial buildings. In the office sector, demand for air conditioning has grown rapidly, and this is associated with a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions. Significant cost-effective CO2 savings have been identified in the sector, using readily available technologies. The Climate Change Levy, and questions of comfort, health and productivity among workers, are pushing energy issues up the agenda for many businesses. However positive action is impeded by barriers in the commercial property sector, such as conflicts of interest between landlords and tenants, poor information and professional conservatism. These barriers act to limit energy efficiency investment, to the detriment of building occupants and wider society for generations to come. These problems will limit the efficacy of existing initiatives that aim to curb commercial sector energy use. The Association for the Conservation of Energy considers that new legislation is needed. This would require freeholders to improve the energy efficiency of their new and existing buildings, in consultation with occupiers and/or unions. Further research is needed on options for sharing the costs and benefits with occupiers and/or energy service companies.

AB By early 1999, the Probe series of post-occupancy studies had reported individually on 16 buildings. This paper compares their energy performance and carbon emissions (for technical performance and occupant satisfaction, see papers 2 and 4 in this issue). All but one building (which paradoxically used the least energy of Probe's air-conditioned offices) claimed to be energy efficient, but achieved performance ranged from excellent to below average. Across the sample, there was a factor of six in carbon dioxide emissions per unit floor area, and even more per occupant. The air-conditioned buildings tended to use the most energy: they usually contained more equipment, were more intensively occupied, but also usually ran more liberally and wastefully - as did more complex systems generally. Often complication seemed to have been added before the fundamentals had been made efficient. Design objectives were also frustrated by poor airtightness, control problems, unintended consequences, a dearth of energy management, and a tendency for systems to default to 'on' - also a pathological trend for information technology and its associated cooling demands. Solutions include load reduction, 'gentle engineering', better matches between demand and supply, and predictions based on a better understanding of in-use performance.

AB Patterns of the evolution of aggregate carbon intensity from residential end uses show greater variability than other sectors. For some countries in this analysis, this measure exhibits significant decreases, while for other countries this measure exhibits significant increases over the period of analysis. The Adaptive Weighted Divisia rolling base year index specification is applied to carbon emissions from the residential sector for 10 OECD countries,for the period 1970-1993. Decreases in aggregate carbon intensity for six of the countries range less than 8% to almost 72%, and may be attributed to changes in three different factors. However, for all of the countries, decreases are offset by shifts in end-use structure toward more carbon-intensive activities. These shifts are driven by an increase in the number of households with a corresponding increase in floor space, acquisition of greater numbers of major appliances and by an increase in the 'other' energy consumption category.

AB A method for estimating CO2 emissions given off over the entire life cycle of various types of residential buildings was examined. In the method for estimating CO2 emissions, the life cycle of a residential building was divided into four stages (manufacturing, construction, operation, and demolition). The result showed that CO2 emissions resulting from construction, including manufacturing building materials for residential building were in the range of 381.1-620.1 kg-C/10 m(2) for each building type. However, Most CO2 emissions given off during the residential building life cycle were due to the building operation having 87.5-96.9% of total CO2 emissions. And when comparing residential building types, single-family houses using liquefied petroleum gas as the main heating energy source had the lowest CO2 emissions, with 5,260 kg-C/10 m(2) of floor area during their life cycles. On the other hand, single-family houses using briquette as the main heating energy source had the highest CO2 emissions (15,100 k-C/10 m(2)), with emissions being 2.9 times more than those of the (former) single-family house using liquefied petroleum gas.

AB 1 Background. The U.S. Government has encouraged shifting from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to alternatively fueled vehicles such as electric vehicles (EVs) for three primary reasons: reducing oil dependence, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing Clean Air Act criteria pollutant emissions. In comparing these vehicles, there is uncertainty and variability in emission factors and performance variables, which cause wide variation in reported outputs.
   2 Objectives. A model was developed to demonstrate the use of Monte Carlo simulation to predict life cycle emissions and energy consumption differences between the ICEV versus the EV on a per kilometer (km) traveled basis. Three EV technologies are considered: lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, and nickel metal hydride batteries.
   3 Methods. Variables were identified to build life cycle inventories between the EVs and ICEV. Distributions were selected for each of the variables and input to Monte Carlo Simulation software called Crystal Ball 2000(R).
   4 Results and Discussion. All three EV options reduce U,S. oil dependence by shifting to domestic coal. The life cycle energy consumption per kilometer (km) driven for the EVs is comparable to the ICEV; however, there is wide variation in predicted energy values. The model predicts that all three EV technologies will likely increase oxides of sulfur and nitrogen as well as particulate matter emissions on a per km driven basis, The model shows a high probability that volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide emissions are reduced with the use of EVs. Lead emissions are also predicted to increase for lead-acid battery EVs. The EV will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions substantially and may even increase them based on the current U.S. reliance on coal for electricity generation. The EV may benefit public health by relocating air pollutants from urban centers, where traffic is concentrated, to rural areas where electricity generation and mining generally occur. The use of Monte Carlo simulation in life cycle analysis is demonstrated to be an effective tool to provide further insight on the likelihood of emission outputs and energy consumption.

AB Intention, Goal, Scope, Background, Objectives. Environmental effects caused by the railway transport services have rarely been investigated in depth from a systemic point of view. A screening LCA, called ecology profile, of the German high-speed passenger train system, the ICE, is presented here, based on a study conducted by the University of Halle and the Deutsche Balm AG, the major German rail operator. In this study, the resource consumption caused by traction, manufacturing and maintenance of ICE trains, as well as construction and operation of the supporting, rail infrastructure and buildings, have been evaluated using cumulative energy demand (CED), cumulative material input per service unit (MIPS) and CO2 emissions as indicators.
   Methods. Approximately 200 items of inventory data were collected from DB AG experts, manufacturers, site balances and the associated literature. They were allocated in order to derive 100-person-kilometre-related mass and energy consumption figures. The appropriate CED, MIPS and CO2 factors were applied in order to quantify the indirect efforts associated with the inventory data.
   Conclusions. For the reference high-speed route investigated, Hanover-Wuerzburg, the railroad infrastructure does not contribute the high share of resource consumption to the life cycle of the transport service which was expected from other studies. For the reference route, the CED of the infrastructure contributes 13% to the total CED per 100 person kilometres, whilst the energy demand of the traction process dominates the life cycle. Within the railway infrastructure, the construction of tunnels and the heating of rail points during winter time are significant primary-energy active components, whereas the energy requirement for maintaining the railway stations is a minor factor in comparison. The environmental impact of new technologies for designing rail tracks have also been analysed. The new ballastless slab track technology investigated needs higher absolute resource inputs in the construction phase compared with the traditional gravel bed, but due to higher life expectancy, it competes favourably at the 100-person-kilometre level, at least in terms of material requirements. Efforts to reduce the traction energy consumption of the ICE train will have the greatest impact on the CED of the transport system. In summary, a total of 48 kg of solid primary resources are needed for a passenger to travel 100 kin by ICE.
   Recommendations/Outlook. The results presented can be used for modelling other high-speed railway transport systems. A comparison of the ecology profiles of the German, French and Japanese high-speed train systems would be of interest in order to identify potential areas for improvement. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the short-hop, commuter train service. Further efforts should be directed to comparing the infrastructure of the high speed train and that of highway road traffic.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions and costs over the life cycle of wood and
   alternative flooring materials
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Increased use of wood can substitute more energy demanding products and thus contribute to a long-term solution to the global warming problem. The aim of this article is to provide an empirical study on this substitution impact, its cost-effectiveness, and which methodological assumptions that are of highest importance for the results obtained. We have made a case study where we compare use of various flooring materials. The results show that floor covering in solid oak causes lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than the other materials. The difference can be ranked in the following order, after their potential for reduction in GHG emissions: Carpet in wool, carpet in polyamide, vinyl, and linoleum. At 2% pro anno discount rate, the avoided GHG emission in tons per m(3) of oak flooring used is 0.1 - 1.9 for linoleum, and 11.8 - 15.5 for wool carpets. Unless the solution in solid oak is on total less expensive over the lifetime of the building, only the price of avoided emissions from a substitution between solid oak and carpet in wool is reasonable, compared to present carbon fees. The assumptions that influence the result most are choice of discount rate, carbon fixation on forest area, and waste handling. Empirical case studies like this indicate GHG emission reduction potentials caused by substitution, but should be complemented by dynamic input/output analyses and econometric studies. To analyse the flow of CO2 over time, they should also be linked to forest management models.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) observations above the densely built-up center of Marseille during the Experience sur site pour contraindre les modeles de pollution atmospherique et de transport d'emissions (ESCOMPTE) summertime measurement campaign extend current understanding of surface atmosphere exchanges in cities. The instrument array presented opportunities to address issues of the representativeness of local-scale fluxes in urban settings. Separate EC systems operated at two levels, and a telescoping tower allowed the pair to be exposed at two different sets of heights. The flux and turbulence observations taken at the four heights, stratified by wind conditions (mistral wind and sea breeze), are used to address the partitioning of the surface energy balance in an area with large roughness elements. The turbulent sensible heat flux dominates in the daytime, although the storage heat flux is a significant term that peaks before solar noon. The turbulent latent heat flux is small but not negligible. Carbon dioxide fluxes show that this central city district is almost always a source, but the vegetation reduces the magnitude of the fluxes in the afternoon. The atmosphere in such a heavily developed area is rarely stable. The turbulence characteristics support the empirical functions proposed by M. Roth.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. This paper gives an overview on how the wood and packaging material production is inventoried in ecoinvent. Packaging materials have been a very important topic in the area of Life Cycle Assessment for more than twenty years. Wood is the most important renewable material and regenerative fuel used worldwide, and an important raw material for paper / board. Several methodological problems arising when inventorying wood for material and energetic uses in a generic database are discussed in more detail. Within the ecoinvent project, the Swiss data base for life cycle inventory data, two reports are dedicated to these two important topics - report No. 9 for wood and report No. 11 for packaging materials.
   Methods. The whole wood chain has been modeled in a consistent way. This allows one to use this data for LCAs of building materials, bioenergy or paper production. The data represent average technologies used in Central Europe in the year 2000. A revenue-based co-product allocation approach is used for the different outputs. Correction factors are introduced for the consistent modeling of mass-based, material inherent wood properties such as solar energy, carbon uptake and land use. For packaging materials, the datasets represent European average data for the most often used materials as well as specific datasets for the production of actual packaging boxes and containers.
   Results and Discussion. For wood, revenue-based allocation and the use of the correction factors for mass-related wood properties are shown and explained. For packaging materials, the importance of the raw material wood to the total load is shown. Furthermore trends in the data inventories for board packaging materials over the last two decades are discussed: mainly due to the increased comprehensiveness of the data, higher cumulative emissions can be observed.
   Conclusion. For wood, the database ecoinvent provides consistent datasets for the entire chain from forestry to intermediate products such as timber, different types of wood-based boards, chips, pellets, etc. For packaging materials, the number of datasets of basic materials has been extended. A modular concept for actual packaging container datasets allows the user an easy modeling of various types of packaging containers/boxes. In the area of paper and board, a comprehensive database for the production of various types of pulp, paper and board is provided, which is representative for the average European production situation.
   Outlook. Since wood is only limited and representative data for Europe is therefore not included, an update in the near future would be reasonable. Possible further extensions in the future could include various, final wooden products. For the data on paper/board, different levels of quality are observed, requiring a selective up-date of these data. Future extensions could include datasets for the import of pulp from overseas - especially from South America and Canada.

   modelling; water transport
AB Background, Goal and Scope. The ecoinvent database is a reference work for life cycle inventory data covering the areas of energy, building materials, metals, chemicals, paper and cardboard, forestry, agriculture, detergents, transport services and waste treatment. Generic inventories are available for freight and passenger transport including air, rail, road, and water transport. The goal of freight transport modelling is to provide background data for transport services, which occur between nearly any two process steps of a product system. This paper presents and discusses the model structure, basic assumptions and results for selected freight transport services.
   Main Features. Transport services are divided into several datasets referred to as transport components. In addition to vehicle operation (comprising vehicle travel and pre-combusrion), infrastructure processes such as vehicle maintenance, manufacturing and disposal, as well as transport infrastructure construction, operation and disposal, are also modelled. In order to link the various transport components to the functional unit of one tonne kilometre (tkm), so-called demand factors are determined. In the case of transport infrastructure that is not exclusively used by freight transport, allocation is essential. The respective allocation parameters employed for line infrastructure construction/disposal and operation datasets (including land use) are yearly Gross-tonne kilometre performance (Gtkm) and kilometric vehicle/train performance.
   Results are presented for selected environmental exchanges related to gaseous emissions (climate change gases, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons), heavy metal (zinc and cadmium) emissions to soil and air, as well as BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and land use. Particle emissions are further distinguished into fine (PM2.5) and coarse (diameter between 2.5 and 10 mum) particles. The results presented comprise both an intra- and intermodal comparison.
   Results and Discussions. A comparison of Swiss and European rail transport reveals considerably lower emissions from Swiss rail transport due to the almost exclusive use of hydropower as traction energy. For gaseous emissions, freight transport by water or rail exhibits considerably better performance than road transport (65-92% less gaseous emissions). As far as zinc and cadmium emissions to soil are concerned, water and rail transport produce less than 1% of the emissions resulting from road transport for either pollutant. For zinc and cadmium emissions to air, road transport has the highest emissions; however, the emissions due to water and rail transport range from 2 to 18% of the emission levels arising from road transport. Particle emissions show a more diverse pattern. Whilst fine particle emissions due to water and rail transport are considerably lower than road transport, rail transport with respect to coarse particles performs worse than road transport. Dominance analysis reveals the importance of infrastructure processes. For instance, the NMHC-emissions of infrastructure processes account for 40%, 30% and 50% of emissions for road, rail and barge transport, respectively. For the demand factor of infrastructure operation, a sensitivity analysis of the employed allocation factor was performed, revealing no sensitivity for gaseous emissions and particles. On the other hand, considerable changes in both emission levels and in the ranking of transport modes is observed for land occupation. Finally, we varied selected operation parameters for road transport, resulting in considerable reductions of CO2 and NOx emissions of Lip to 60%. In one extreme case (load factor: 100%), NOx emissions for vehicle operation of a lorry are lower than for inland water transport. Only as a result of the considerably higher NOx emissions occutting in infrastructure processes does road transport score worse than water transport, with the ranking remaining the same as for the generic data presented in ecoinvent 2000.
   Conclusions and Perspectives. The provided datasets allow for a preliminary screening of the importance of transport processes within a product life cycle. In the cases for which transport processes are identified as sensitive for the overall outcome of certain product life cycle or for transport specific comparisons, the modular structure and transparent documentation of demand factors allows for an easy and transparent integration of more case-specific data for selected transport components.

AB An on-site generator, such as CGS (cogeneration system), is considered to be an effective end-use energy system in order to accomplish primary energy conservation, CO2 emissions mitigation, and system cost reduction; these characteristics will eventually improve the complete performance of an existing energy system in the future. Considering the drawback of installing an end-use CGS for a customer possessing small or middle-scale floor space, however, it is difficult to achieve those distinctive features because the thermal-electricity ratio of CGS is not always in agreement with that of customer energy demand. In order to overcome that matching deficiency, it is better to organize an on-site generator network based on mutual electricity and heating transmission. But focusing on some cogenerators underlying their behaviors regarding maximizing their own profits, this on-site network, whose situation corresponds to a grand coalition, is not necessarily established because of each cogenerator's motivation to form a partial coalition and acquire its own profit as much as possible.
   In this paper, we attempt to analyze the optimal operation of an on-site generator network and identify by applying the nucleolus of cooperative game theory the optimal benefit allocation strategy in order for the cogenerators to construct the network. Regarding the installation site of this network, the center of Tokyo city is assumed; the locational information includes floor space and so forth through a GIS (geographic information system) database. The results from the nucleolus suggest that all districts should impartially obtain benefit from organizing the network for the purpose of jointly attaining system total cost reduction.

AB The application of bioclimatic principles is a critical factor in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the building sector. This paper develops a regression model of energy efficiency as a function of environmental conditions, building characteristics and passive solar technologies. A sample of 77 bioclimatic buildings (including 45 houses) was collected, covering Greece, other Mediterranean areas and the rest of Europe. Average energy efficiency varied from 19.6 to 100% with an average of about 68%. Environmental conditions included latitude, altitude, ambient temperature, degree days and sun hours; building characteristics consisted in building area and volume. Passive solar technologies included (among others) solar water heaters, shading, natural ventilation, greenhouses and thermal storage walls. Degree days and a dummy variable indicating location in the Mediterranean area were the strongest predictors of energy efficiency while taller and leaner buildings tended to be more energy efficient. Surprisingly, many passive technologies did not appear to make a difference on energy efficiency while thermal storage walls in fact seemed to decrease energy efficiency. The model developed may be of use to architects, engineers and policy makers. Suggestions for further research include obtaining more building information, investigating the effect of passive solar technologies and gathering information on the usage of building.

TI Energy efficiency -: a forgotten goal in the Swedish building sector?
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy efficiency; carbon dioxide emissions; building sector
ID EMISSIONS; DEMAND; METHODOLOGY; COUNTRIES
AB The paper analyses trends in energy use and carbon dioxide emissions in the Swedish building sector between 1970 and 2000 with focus on the development of energy efficiency in the average stock of buildings and in the new construction. The energy efficiency improved throughout the seventies and early eighties, and studies revealed major potentials for further improvements. However, the energy efficiency has levelled off with almost no improvement during the nineties. The statistics for new-constructed multi-dwelling buildings indicate increasing energy use per floor area since 1995, and even more amazing: the new-constructed multi-dwelling buildings are at the same level of energy efficiency as the average existing building. Parallel to this development, the best available technology represented by low-energy buildings, uses less than a third of the energy used in average new buildings. Much of this development may be explained by changes in energy prices. The increasing oil price between 1972 and 1985 correlates well with the improvements in energy efficiency, even though the effect was limited by the low electricity price following the nuclear power programme. However, promotion of energy efficiency is complicated by the ineffective distribution of costs and benefits between actors, especially in the new construction. Moreover, to the residents energy cost is a small part of the expenditures and energy efficiency is merely one of many qualities valued in a building. An important factor behind the increasing energy use in new-constructed multi-dwelling buildings may also be new exceptions in the energy standards which were introduced to promote district heating. Finally, the paper gives some policy recommendations to improve the energy efficiency in the Swedish building sector: Not to support supply substitution at the expense of energy efficiency; Regulations for individual measurements and debiting of space and water heating; Strengthening of the energy standards to promote technical efficiency in the new construction.

AB Attempts to improve the energy performance in the residential sector mainly pay attention to new buildings. However, a decrease in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions will never occur if nothing is done to improve the existing energy devouring housing stock. This paper discusses economically feasible ways and means to choose between insulation measures, better glazing, installation measures and renewable energy systems such as solar collectors and PV cells. Finally a logical hierarchy of energy-saving measures is deduced from the results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE clean energy system; long-term emission reduction technologies;
   sustainable energy future
AB In this paper, two long-term visions of the Dutch future energy system are composed, analysed and evaluated. Both visions were set tip to meet the requirement to reduce the GHG emissions with 80% in 2050 in comparison to 1990. The two visions start from very different perspectives and contexts. Quantitative analysis shows that when economic growth and energy use follow a business as usual development. emissions of GreenHouse Gases (GHG) can increase up to 250% of 1990 levels. The two, rather opposing, visions show that it is feasible to combine (strong) economic growth with far going reduction of GHG emissions, provided a number of key options are developed and applied. These options were chosen and discussed during several meetings by stakeholders in a dialogue process, Using feedback from scientists, and consist of improvements in energy efficiency in industry, CO2 neutral feedstocks for transportation, renewable energy and highly insulated buildings in the built environment and improvements in the primary production of the agricultural sector. It is clear that drastic changes in many areas in society are required to obtain the desired GHG-emission levels in 2050. The results also show though, that such a development can be realised in different ways. In other Words. there are various ways to implement a low GHG emission economy in the long term.

AB Within five years from now, Lithuania is going to close down Ignalina, the only nuclear-power plant in the country. Since Ignalina generates more than 75% of the Lithuanian electricity production, new generation capacities are needed. Traditional steam-turbines, fuelled with fossil fuels, would mean further imports of fuel as well as a rise in CO2 emissions. At the same time, several small district-heating companies one suffering from high heating-prices. Typically, the price in small towns is 20-50% higher than the price in large urban areas. Consequently, alternative strategies should be considered. This article analyses the conditions for one such strategy, namely the replacement of boilers in the existing district-heating supplies with combined heat-and-power production (CHP). Compared with new power stations, fuel can be saved and CO2-emissions reduced. Also this strategy can be used to level the difference between low heating prices in the large urban areas and high prices in small towns and villages. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability has been enshrined as a goal of society to ensure that the satisfaction of present needs does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is thus a social objective, achievable only where all areas of society co-operate in fulfilling the associated demands. Ecological sustainability is, in turn, a basic prerequisite for sustainable economic and social development. The first step in formulating an effective response to this challenge, focused solely on the environmental issues, entails a quantification of the contribution required from the various areas of human activity for the achievement of sustainable development. Without binding sub-targets for the different sectors, it will be all but impossible to move systematically towards a sustainable society. These benchmarks for sustainable construction therefore set out to define the requirements to be met by buildings and structures in contributing to the achievement of a sustainable society. The permissible impact of buildings, in terms of energy demand and pollutant loads, during construction, maintenance and operation is determined. The analysis focuses on identifying the permissible levels of loads based on the specific energy consumption per in 2 and year for heating, hot water, electricity and construction.

   The study shows that buildings designed to the Passive House standard just about comply with the requirements for sustainable construction, provided electricity generation is based largely on renewable or low-CO2 resources (Swiss power supply mix). The targets are substantially harder to meet where mainly fossil-fuel-generated electricity (European supply mix UCTE) is used. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.v. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY POLICY

DT Article
DE renewable energy; potential evaluation; geographic information system
AB The issue of regulating greenhouse gas emissions of developing countries is one of the main reasons for the US's retreat from ratifying the Kyoto Protocal, and this deserves particular attention in order to ensure that a robust international climate policy exists in the future. Enabling developing countries to move toward low-carbon energy systems would enhance the feasibility for their participation in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This study evaluates wind, solar, and biomass energy sources in a rural area of Chigu in southwestern Taiwan by means of analyzing technical, economic, environmental, and political implications in order to establish an evaluation model for developing local renewable energy sources. The adopted approach evaluates local potentials of renewable energy sources with the aid of a geographic information system according to actual local conditions, and allows the assessment to consider local potentials and restrictions such as climate conditions, land uses, and ecological environments, thus enabling a more-accurate assessment than is possible with evaluations on an approximate basis. These results may help build a developmental vision for sustainable energy systems based on locally available natural resources, and facilitate a transition of national energy and environmental policies towards sustainability.

AB An eco-efficiency analysis was conducted using indicators suitably defined to evaluate the performance of an electrochromic window acting as an energy saving component in buildings. Combining the indicators for various parameters (control scenario, expected lifetime, climatic type, purchase cost) significant conclusions are drawn for the development and the potential applications of the device compared to other commercial fenestration products. The reduction of the purchase cost (to 200E/m(2)) and the increase of the lifetime (above 15 years) are the two main targets for achieving both cost and environmental efficiency. An electrochromic device, implemented in cooling dominated areas and operated with an optimum control strategy for the maximum expected lifetime (25 years), can reduce the building energy requirements by 52%. Furthermore, the total energy savings provided will be 33 times more than the energy required for its production while the emission of 615 kg CO2 equivalent per electrochromic glazing unit can be avoided.

TI AIR CONDITIONING-A LUXURY OR A NECESSITY IN GREEN BUILDINGS?
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB Air conditioning is firmly entrenched in modern U.S. lifestyles, with over 80% of all new houses being centrally heated and cooled. This trend will likely remain in place even as energy prices increase along with pressure to reduce global carbon emissions. Air conditioning has been the major factor behind the explosive growth of the Sunbelt in the south and southwest. Las Vegas, Phoenix, Houston, Miami and many other cities would be only small regional centers if not for the availability of air conditioning for businesses and residences. Air conditioning is becoming more accepted even in areas where it was previously shunned, such as parts of Europe which experienced the severe beat wave in 2002 that was responsible for the deaths of thousands. Given its prominence in our modern society, we must learn to use air conditioning in an intelligent and efficient manner so we can benefit from the quality of life it provides, but without bankrupting our energy resources and permanently altering our global environment.

DT Article
DE scenario building; hydrogen economy; roadmapping
ID TECHNOLOGIES; PERSPECTIVE
AB Scenarios, roadmaps and similar foresight methods are used to cope with uncertainty in areas with long planning horizons, such as energy policy, and research into the future of hydrogen energy is no exception. Such studies can play an important role in the development of shared visions of the future: creating powerful expectations of the potential of emerging technologies and mobilising resources necessary for their realisation.
   This paper reviews the hydrogen futures literature, using a six-fold typology to map the state of the art of scenario construction. The paper then explores the expectations embodied in the literature, through the 'answers' it provides to questions about the future of hydrogen. What are the drivers, barriers and challenges facing the development of a hydrogen economy? What are the key technological building blocks required? In what kinds of futures does hydrogen become important? What does a hydrogen economy look like, how and when does it evolve, and what does it achieve?
   The literature describes a diverse range of possible futures, from decentralised systems based upon small-scale renewables, through to centralised systems reliant on nuclear energy or carbon-sequestration. There is a broad consensus that the hydrogen economy emerges only slowly, if at all, under 'Business as Usual' scenarios. Rapid transitions to hydrogen occur only under conditions of strong governmental support combined with, or as a result of, major 'discontinuities' such as shifts in society's environmental values, 'game changing' technological breakthroughs, or rapid increases in the oil price or speed and intensity of climate change.

ID ENERGY; FUTURE
AB In this paper an image of a sustainable transport system for Sweden in 2050 is outlined. The emissions per capita in this image may be generalized to a global population of 9 billions, and still be consistent with a stabilization of the carbon dioxide concentration at 450ppm (parts per million). Swedish transport energy use per capita is 4.6MWh in the image, compared to 12.5MWh at present. The aim is, first, to widen the perspective of sustainable transport futures and, second, to provide a basis for present decisions in areas characterized by a high inertia, e.g. regarding infrastructure and the built-up environment. All transport generated by the lifestyles of Swedish residents are included. The reduction of energy use in the image is primarily achieved by an introduction of energy efficient vehicles and a conscious combination of IT-services and urban planning. The latter aims at increasing functional accessibility while reducing commuting. A prioritization of leisure travel to structurally-enforced travel gives the possibility to increase leisure travel per capita by one third. However, this is contingent on a 50% reduction of per capita car travel in cities. Given the set-up target, it may be concluded that the need for new arterial road capacity in cities often is negligible, even with a considerable population increase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   case of Greece
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English

ID ENERGY-CONSERVATION; TECHNOLOGIES; INFORMATION
AB During the last decade the CO2 emissions from the residential and tertiary sectors have been rising continuously. This is cause for concern but also an area to be targeted for emission reduction measures in national action plans. This paper proposes a methodological framework, using the Greek building sector (characterized by an aging building stock constructed mostly in the period before 1980) as a case study for the examination of the economic attractiveness of possible measures, which incorporates crucial parameters such as local climate, use of buildings, age of building stock, etc. that affect the energy conservation potential and consequently the economic performance of available measures. Utilizing this framework, the approach is able to classify measures into three categories, namely 'win-win' cases (i.e. where the implementation of emission reduction measures presents a net economic benefit for end-users), measures that require the implementation of appropriate economic support policies in order to make them economically attractive for end-users, and measures that have excessive cost. The results indicate that the emissions reduction potential of 'win-win' cases is significant. They also demonstrate how individual measures can provide significant reductions if carefully targeted economic support policies are applied. Finally, sensitivity analyses performed with respect to the discount rate applied indicate that it has a substantial impact on the economic performance of some measures and consequently on the magnitude of the 'win-win' potential associated to emissions reduction.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. The idea of district heating is to transport centrally produced heat to buildings where it is used for space heating and for domestic hot water generation. Water is used as a heat carrier. Many different heat sources are used to supply district heating networks with hot water. In literature, environmental studies on district heating mainly consider emissions from the heat generation; environmental impacts from the distribution system are seldom discussed. This paper is the third in an article series on the environmental impacts from the district heat distribution system. The paper presents an evaluation of the use phase of district heat distribution, focusing on long-term thermal performance of different district heating pipes. An overall discussion, in which environmental impacts from the different life cycle phases of district heat distribution are compared, is also presented.
   Methods for the Use Phase Study. Environmental impacts from use of district heat distribution systems were evaluated based on heat losses from the networks, which depend on the long-term thermal performance of the district heating pipes. The heat losses cause environmental impacts from extra heat generation needed to cover the losses.
   The long-term thermal performance of preinsulated bonded district heating pipes with steel tube, polyurethane foam insulation and polyethylene casing, depends on the thickness and quality of both the insulation and the casing. One important attribute of the foam is the blowing agent used. The blowing agent influences both the initial insulating capacity of the foam and the ageing characteristics, due to differences in migration rates of different substances through the materials.
   Heat losses were calculated for different district heating pipe dimensions (DN25 twin pipe, and DN25, DN100 and DN500 Series 2 single pipes). Pipes with two different foam blowing agents (cyclopentane and carbon dioxide) were studied, taking into account the differences in long-term thermal performance of the foams. Concerning emissions from heat generation, two heat sources were considered: heat generation according to the average district heating fuel mix used in Sweden in the year of 2000, and heat generation using natural gas heat only boilers. The functional unit used is 100 m of district heat distribution network during 30 years of use.
   Results and Discussion on the Use Phase. A short description of the inventory, some inventory results and a life cycle impact assessment are presented. Characterizations according to GWP, AP, POCP and resource depletion are given as well as two weightings: EcoIndicator99 and Ecoscarcity. The DN25 twin pipe network has about 25% lower environmental impacts from use than the DN25 Series 2 single pipe network. The district heating pipes insulated with cyclopentane blown polyurethane foam have a better environmental performance during use compared to those insulated with carbon dioxide blown foam (6-13%). This is partly dependent on a higher initial insulating capacity of the cyclopentane blown foam, but also due to a slower deterioration of the insulating capacity over time. For the two heat sources considered, different impact assessments give different indications to which option that is environmentally preferable.
   Overall Results and Discussion on Pipe Production, Network Construction and Network Use Phases. A comparison of the three life cycle phases studied in this article series was made concerning four emissions, the four characterizations and the two weightings. The use phase represents over half of the total environmental impact for most, but not all, environmental parameters studied. It is important to keep the heat losses from the network down and to strive for heat sources with low environmental impacts. The larger the pipe, the larger is the relative impact from pipe production. The network construction phase has a relatively small contribution to the total environmental impact in most systems studied. However, the emissions during network construction often occur in residential areas and may therefore not be neglected when immediate nuisances and health aspects are considered. A very small change of the material flows in the production phase, the change between two different blowing agents (cyclopentane and carbon dioxide), can give dramatic results for the total environmental outcome for the district heating network because of a large change in influence on environmental impacts during use. The DN25 twin pipe network proves to be environmentally advantageous compared to the DN25 Series 2 single pipe network during all of the studied life cycle phases.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. It is important to make sure that improvements in the production and construction phases do not lower the insulating capacity of the district heating system. A good initial insulating capacity, maintained over time, is important for the environmental performance of a district heat distribution network. Using DN25 twin pipes instead of DN25 Series 2 single pipes is a better choice, when possible, regarding all studied life cycle phases. The environmental impact from use of the district heat distribution system depends heavily on the type of energy source that is utilized to supply the network with heat.

AB Theoretical analysis of a solar energy-powered Rankine thermodynamic cycle utilizing an innovative new concept, which uses supercritical carbon dioxide as a working fluid, is presented. In this system, a truly 'natural' working fluid, carbon dioxide, is utilized to generate firstly electricity power and secondly high-grade heat power and low-grade heat power. The uniqueness of the system is in the way in which both solar energy and carbon dioxide, available in abundant quantities in all parts of the world, are simultaneously used to build up a thermodynamic cycle and has the potential to reduce energy shortage and greatly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, offering environmental and personal safety simultaneously. The system consists of an evacuated solar collector system, a power-generating turbine, a high-grade heat recovery system, a low-grade heat recovery system and a feed pump. The performances of this CO2-based Rankine cycle were theoretically investigated and the effects of various design conditions, namely, solar radiation, solar collector area and CO2 flow rate, were studied. Numerical simulations show that the proposed system may have electricity power efficiency and heat power efficiency as high as 11.4% and 36.2%, respectively. It is also found that the cycle performances strongly depend on climate conditions. Also the electricity power and heat power outputs increase with the collector area and CO2 flow rate. The estimated COPpower and COPheat increase with the CO, flow rate, but decrease with the collector area. The CO2-based cycle can be optimized to provide maximum power, maximum heat recovery or a combination of both. The results suggest the potential of this new concept for applications to electricity power and heat power generation.

TI Electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating in the
   Swedish building sector -: Current trends in conflict with governmental
   policy?
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE heating; building sector; CO2 emissions
AB Coal-condensing power is marginal production in the deregulated Nordic power market and an increase in electricity consumption will therefore result in increased CO2 emissions. One goal of the Swedish energy policy is to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating in the building sector. This paper investigates the potential for reduction in electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating, taking the energy infrastructure into account, here defined as the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity. In order to include the energy infrastructure in the analysis the study is made on a regional level (Southern Sweden) applying a comprehensive database describing the energy infrastructure of the region. The paper compares two scenarios for converting the heating systems of the region: one employing energy savings and with the aim to phase out the oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes and a second which illustrates the effect if the current trend in the heating market continues. Both scenarios apply commercially available technologies only. From the second scenario it is seen that the current trend-contrary to the aim of the Swedish Governmental policy-shows an increase in electricity dependency for heating, mainly due to a large diffusion of heat pumps, but also due to installations of electrical floor heating and electricity heating systems installed in newly constructed one- and two-dwelling buildings. However, the options proposed in first scenario show that it is possible to reach significant reductions in the electricity dependency due to heating and in corresponding CO2 emissions. An analysis of the age structure of the heating systems shows that the transformation of the heating system is not completed until the year 2025, if new investments for replacement of heating systems are made only provided they have reached their economical life time, and only applying heating technologies which at present are known to be economically competitive. It can be concluded that future policies on transforming the energy system should be based on an analysis that takes the entire energy infrastructure (in this case of heating system) into account (e.g. not directed towards single technologies). More specifically for the region studied, which is considered representative for Sweden as a whole, policies should aim at installing heat pumps to replace electricity heating only in regions with low heat density where district heating is not competitive, in contrary to the present situation where heat pumps replace all types of heating systems.

AB The effective integration of an artificial lighting system and daylight in buildings occurs only when the artificial lighting system can be switched on or off as a function of daylight levels reaching the working surface of spaces. The paper considers fibre optics technology as a means of supplementing the daylight received at the rear of rooms and the subsequent integration of the total daylight received with a controlled artificial lighting system. Such an approach would contribute not only to energy savings but also to a reduction in environmental pollution. The evaluation took place using the climatic data from seven cities in Brazil and one in the UK. Results showed that by effectively integrating daylight from windows in buildings with the artificial lighting system, energy savings ranging from 17.7% to 92.0% could be achieved in the seven cities in Brazil and savings ranging from 10.8% to 44.0% could be achieved in the UK. By incorporating fibre optic technology into the system, the potential for energy savings on lighting was then found to range from 8.0% to 82.3% for the cities in Brazil and from 56.0% to 89.2% in the UK. For the city in the UK, it was further shown that there would be a reduction in carbon dioxide emission of 122kg/m(2) of built area per year if daylight from windows were integrated with the artificial lighting system, and that this would increase to 138 kg/m(2) per year if fibre optics technology were to be installed.

AB Electrochromic evacuated advanced glazing has been developed, combining optimum dynamic control of the solar radiation penetrating into buildings with a high degree of thermal insulation. This was achieved by the optimisation of the electrochromic device materials (electrochromic, ion storage, protective layers, transparent conductors and polymer electrolytes) and by the refinement of a sealing method for evacuated glazing. Electrochromic evacuated glazing prototypes with dimensions up to 40 cm x 40 cut have been fabricated using vacuum techniques and chemical methods. The prototypes exhibit excellent optical and thermal performance, with a contrast ratio up to 1:32 (visible dynamic transmittance range T-lum,T-bleached 63% and T-lum,T-colored = 2%), coloration efficiency up to 92 cm(2)/C and mid-pane U-values as low as 0.86 W m(-2) K-1. Their durability in relation to real working environmental conditions has been assessed through indoor and outdoor testing. Such a glazing can be used in building applications to improve occupant thermal comfort, contribute to a reduction in space heating and cooling loads and allow for increased areas of fenestration thereby reducing artificial lighting loads. These factors reduce the energy demand for the building and therefore contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The task of achieving major CO2 reductions in the residential building stock raises a wide range of policy issues, from the relationship between the rate of demolition and preserving 'heritage' areas, the standards of new build, embodied energy, roof orientation, and the provision of on-site generation. These are all vital, but the paramount task is the refurbishment of the existing building stock. In the UK, 87% of existing homes are expected to be standing in 2050, with a space-heating demand that has been reduced from 14 600 to 9000 kWh per year through the provision of high levels of insulation and measures to avoid the need for air-conditioning. For all homes, old and new, major carbon reductions will require the installation of low- and zero-carbon technologies and reduced energy consumption in appliances. The scale and urgency of the task is identified, with some pointers, to progress the policy debate. The research is based on the 40% House (2005) report and uses Oxford's UK Domestic Carbon Model. Whilst most of the evidence comes from UK households, the lessons have wider ramifications, both for other sectors and for other countries. Behavioural change will be a vital component, whether from the different professions and trades involved, or from the occupants.

AB An overview of climate change mitigation opportunities in the world's buildings is presented, based on the key building-specific findings of the Fourth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. Buildings and the building stock can play a major role in mitigating climate change in the short- to medium-term, since substantial reductions in CO2 emissions from their energy use can be achieved over the coming years. A significant portion of these savings can be achieved in ways that reduce life cycle costs, thus providing reductions in CO2 emissions that have a net negative cost. There are indications that the building stock has the highest share of negative- and low-cost greenhouse gas reduction potential among all sectors. Based on 80 collected national or regional studies estimating CO2 mitigation potential in five continents, the global potential for CO2 reductions through buildings is analysed and estimated. The co-benefits associated with the implementation of these measures are also substantial, helping policy-makers justify actions even in the absence of a strong climate commitment. Since the barriers to unlocking the high potentials in the residential and commercial sectors are especially strong, no single instrument can make a large impact. Instead, portfolios of targeted policies tailored to local conditions, combined with strong compliance and enforcement regimes, are needed.

   decarbonization; demolition; energy; housing
AB The implications of some technical options for decarbonizing the UK domestic sector are explored. The main focus is on interactions between dwellings and the energy supply and conversion systems that support them, rather than on the detail of the dwelling stock. Synergies between the electricity supply system, intermediate energy-conversion systems and the dwelling envelope make it possible to achieve 60 - 70% reductions in CO2 emissions with plausible combinations of existing and/or emerging technologies. Sensitivity analysis shows that a halving of the carbon intensity of the UK electricity system, plausible improvements to dwelling envelopes, and extensive use of second law energy-conversion systems (typified by, but not restricted to, heat pumps and combined heat and power) to supply space and water heating render total CO2 emissions insensitive to demolition rates. As a result, increased demolition rates may be unnecessary to achieve deep cuts in carbon emissions from dwellings. Additional insights from this study are the strategic importance of decarbonizing the electricity system and the importance, in developing policy for this sector, of synergies between all components of the energy supply, distribution, conversion and end-use system.

ID BUILT ENVIRONMENT; CHANGE IMPACTS; NORWAY
AB The current Norwegian climate research structures, policies and priorities, mitigation and adaptation options are discussed as well as the development of local climate change projections and adaptation measures. A major difficulty is that Norway's present energy supply has a low carbon intensity because a substantial part derives from hydropower, but increasing demand may be met by gas-fired electricity generation, thereby making efficiency and conservation a much higher priority. A National Action Plan on Climate Research recognizes the need for increased research efforts in several areas, including the impacts on the built environment and the more general impacts on society. Mitigation opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the built environment include increased technological efficiencies, reduced energy usage through improved design, mandatory labelling schemes and a switch to climate neutral fuels for heating. However, radically lower energy requirements and lower U-values will be problematic, requiring new technical solutions and construction methods. There is little integration of policy and strategy for adaptation in Norway. The recognition that climate change will further enhance an array of different, harsh microclimates in Norway, which vary according to individual locality, has led to the development of new adaptation approaches and methods. These allow for the projected local climate to inform decisions on an appropriate design response to meet performance-based codes. The development of design guidance for high-performance building envelopes will, in future, take account of projected local climate. However, there is a tension between the need for standardized national building solutions and the need to adapt to local climatic conditions.

AB The building sector currently contributes approximately one-third of energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide. It is economically possible to achieve a 30% reduction. However, numerous barriers such as financial and behavioural issues, market failures, and misplaced incentives prevent the realization of the high economic potentials. Which policy instruments are the most appropriate and cost-effective for reducing these barriers? To address this question, 20 policy instruments were assessed for their effectiveness in reducing emissions, cost-effectiveness, applicability and special conditions for success. The appraisal is based on over 60 ex-post policy evaluation reports from about 30 countries and country groups, representing best-practice examples of the application of these instruments. Appliance standards, building codes, tax exemptions and voluntary labelling were found to be the most effective policy instruments contrary to others such as Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms or energy/carbon taxation. The most cost-effective instruments, all achieving energy savings at negative costs for society, were appliance standards, demand-side management programmes and mandatory labelling. Since all policy instruments have limitations and only help overcome some barriers, they are most effective if combined into policy packages designed for the respective location, economy and culture.

DE energy consumption; CO2 emissions; residential building stock
AB The aim of this paper is to explore the possibilities to reach two long-term targets regarding energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the Swiss residential building stock: a reduction of the final energy consumption by a factor of 3 and of CO2 emissions by a factor of 5 until 2050. A model is constructed to describe the dynamics of the energy-relevant properties of the residential building stock. Appropriate scenarios are discussed in terms of decisions made during construction or renovation of residential buildings which affect heat demand and determine the energy carriers used for heating and hot water generation. We show that both targets could be reached, although ambitious efforts are necessary. The central element of a successful strategy is to reduce the specific heat demand of existing buildings during renovation and to substitute the heating and hot water systems by less carbon intensive ones. Our results suggest that there is more flexibility to reach the emission target than the energy reduction target. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Heat island is a very well documented climatic phenomenon that has an important energy and environmental impact in the urban environment. The main energy problems are related to the important increase of the energy consumption for cooling purposes as well as to the important increase of the peak electricity load. Heat island in Athens, Greece, is measured during the last decade and its energy impact is calculated in details. The aim of the present paper is to estimate the direct and indirect environmental impact of the heat island effect in Athens. This is achieved through the estimation of the additional ecological footprint caused by the urban heat island phenomenon over the city. The ecological footprint estimation is performed at a first step by calculating the increase of the cooling demand caused by the heat island over the whole city and then by translating the energy to environmental cost. Two years annual experimental data from many urban stations have been used. The results show that the ecological footprint because of the heat island ranges 1.5-2 times the city's political area that have to be reserved every year to compensate the additional CO2 emissions caused by the presence of the heat island effect while the maximum potential ecological footprint, provided that all buildings are air conditioned, is almost 110,000 hectares.

TI Urban energy generation: Influence of micro-wind turbine output on

DE micro-wind; domestic; microgeneration
AB Small scale wind turbines installed within the built environment is classified as microgeneration technology. Such turbines may soon become a commercial reality in the UK as a result of both advancements in technology and new financial incentives provided by the government. In addition, microgeneration technologies, especially those with appreciable resource, have the potential to reduce built environment related CO2 emissions coupled with reductions in consumers' electricity costs. In many cases payback on capital investment is within the lifetime of the device. Microwind turbines installed in certain areas in the UK will fit within such criteria. The work presented here addresses modelling of such installations around the UK and presents a methodology to assess the suitability and the economic viability of micro-wind turbines for domestic dwellings. A modelling tool "mu-Wind" has been developed specifically for studying both energy yields and the payback periods for micro-wind turbines. mu-Wind predicts wind turbine performance prior to installation according to specific power curves either defined by turbine manufacturers or the user. Numerical consideration of wind speed data at specific UK sites was used to estimate energy yields and the results are projected to real electricity demand data from monitored dwellings in the UK. The results show that it is possible to predict with a good degree of accuracy the expected financial payback period for a typical domestic dwelling. Furthermore, the paper postulates that micro-wind technology could have the potential to make a significant impact upon domestic electricity generation when located at the windiest sites in the UK. The likelihood of a proliferation of these turbines in the urban or suburban environment is low but at coastal or inland high elevation sites the technology appears to have a promising future.

TI Primary energy use for heating in the Swedish building sector - Current
   trends and proposed target
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE heating; building sector; primary energy
AB One goal of the Swedish energy policy is to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating in the building sector. This means to reduce the primary energy used for heating which in this paper is analyzed in the context of various heating technologies and CO2 emissions. The analysis is applied to a region in Sweden (southern Sweden) for which detailed information on the energy infrastructure (the capital stock of the buildings and heating systems together with geographical variations in heat intensity) is available from a previous work [Johansson, P., Nylander, A., Johnsson, F., 2005. Electricity dependency and CO2 emissions from heating in the Swedish building sector-current trends in conflict with governmental policy? Energy policy] and which is large enough to be assumed representative for Sweden as a whole. The detailed mapping of the energy infrastructure allows a good estimate on the rate at which the energy system can be expected to be replaced with respect to economical lifetime of the capital stock (the year 2025 in this case). Two scenarios are investigated; a: target scenario for which energy savings are employed (e.g. improving climate shell in buildings) and oil and most of the electricity used for heating purposes are phased out and a second for which the current trend in the heating market continues.
   In the target scenario it is shown that although only applying commercially competitive heating technologies, it is possible to achieve a 47% reduction in primary energy use for heating with a 34% decrease in heat demand together with significant reduction in CO2 emissions. However, the scenario which continues the current trends on the heating market instead yields an increase (of about 10%) in primary energy use (reduction in conversion efficiency) of the heating system of the region over the period studied, in spite of a slight decrease in heat demand (9%, mainly due to energy efficiency measures) as well as in CO2 emissions. In light of the recently proposed introduction of energy performance certification of buildings in Sweden (and in EU), it can be concluded that such a certification system must take into account the primary energy use and local conditions. A politically acceptable way to do so would be to propose municipalities to develop "best strategies" on development of the heating market for various house types and districts within the municipality which can then be included as recommendations in the energy performance certification of the buildings.

AB The existing building stock in European countries accounts for over 40% of final energy consumption in the European Union (EU) member states, of which residential use represents 63% of total energy consumption in the buildings sector. Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the EU energy import dependency (currently at about 48%) and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive (EPBD 2002/91/EC) on the energy performance of buildings, which is currently under consideration in all EU member states. This paper presents an overview of the EU residential building stock and focuses on the Hellenic buildings. It elaborates the methodology used to determine the priorities for energy conservation measures (ECMs) in Hellenic residential buildings to reduce the environmental impact from CO2 emissions, through the implementation of a realistic and effective national action plan. A major obstacle that had to overcome was the need to make suitable assumptions for missing detailed primary data. Accordingly, a qualitative and quantitative assessment of scattered national data resulted to a realistic assessment of the existing residential building stock and energy consumption. This is the first time that this kind of aggregate data is presented on a national level. Different energy conservation scenarios and their impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions were evaluated. Accordingly, the most effective ECMs are the insulation of external walls (33-60% energy savings), weather proofing of openings (16-21%), the installation of double-glazed windows (14-20%), the regular maintenance of central heating boilers (10-12%), and the installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production (50-80%).

The energy performance assessment for existing dwellings (EPA-ED) is a new methodology supported by software, developed in the framework of a European project that focuses on energy related issues for existing residential buildings, in line with the EPBD. This paper presents an overview of the method and software that can be used to perform building energy audits and assess buildings in a uniform way, perform demand and savings calculations, provide owners with specific advice for measures to improve energy performance, issue an energy performance certificate for existing buildings, and include some representative results from the pilot studies performed in several European countries. Also the sister-method EPA-NR, on non-residential buildings, currently under construction, is introduced. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accordingly, the most effective energy conservation measures are: addition of thermal insulation of exposed external walls, primarily in hotels and hospitals; installation of energy efficient lamps; installation of solar collectors for sanitary hot water production, primarily in hotels and health care; installation of building management systems in office/commercial and hotel buildings; replacement of old inefficient boilers; and regular maintenance of central heating boilers.

AB The importance of developing a method to bridge the gap between the current increasing trend of CO2 emission from the commercial sector and the reduced emission level for ensuring long-term sustainability has increased. Various concepts exist for managing the energy use and CO2 emission. These concepts can be categorized into advancement in technologies, dissemination of energy saving measures in buildings, optimization of local energy generation and distribution systems, spatial building stock pattern management, and improvement in CO2 emission factor of the grid electricity. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for energy use in the commercial sector in order to evaluate the options involved in the abovementioned energy management concepts in an integrated manner. In this modeling approach, a district is dealt with as a basic unit. Districts are first classified into several categories according to the spatial building stock pattern, or urban form. The end-use energy consumption per unit floor area is then calculated for each district category using a simulation of energy use in buildings in a representative district; this is used for quantifying the total end-use energy consumption at the municipal level. We carried out a case study in order to demonstrate the simulation capabilities and features of the suggested modeling approach in contrast with the conventional modeling approaches. In this case study, certain scenarios of CO2 abatement integrating the energy management concepts are applied in the commercial sector of Osaka city, Japan, in order to investigate alternative avenues toward which policy efforts must be directed.

TI Baseload coal investment decisions under uncertain carbon legislation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB More than 50% of electricity in the U.S. is generated by coal. The U.S. has large coal resources, the cheapest fuel in most areas. Coal fired power plants are likely to continue to provide much of U.S. electricity. However, the type of power plant that should be built is unclear. Technology can reduce pollutant discharges and capture and sequester the CO2 from coal-fired generation. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides incentives for large scale commercial deployment of Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems (e.g., loan guarantees and project tax credits). This analysis examines whether a new coal plant should be Pulverized Coal (PC) or IGCC. Do stricter emissions standards (PM, SO2, NOx, Hg) justify the higher costs of IGCC over PC? How does potential future carbon legislation affect the decision to add carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology? Finally, can the impact of uncertain carbon legislation be minimized? We find that SO2, NOx, PM, and Hg emission standards would have to be far more stringent than twice current standards to justify the increased costs of the IGCC system. A CO2 tax less than $29/ton would lead companies to continuing to choose PC, paying the tax for emitted CO2. The earlier a decision-maker believes the carbon tax will be imposed and the higher the tax, the more likely companies will choose IGCC w/CCS. Having government announce the date and level of a carbon tax would promote more sensible decisions, but government would have to use a tax or subsidy to induce companies to choose the technology that is best for society.

AB Through a dynamic model of energy system change the paper examines the role of innovation in bringing about a low carbon energy system. The processes of innovation and technological substitution are cumulative, dynamic, and highly non-linear processes such that how the energy system evolves in the long term is extraordinarily sensitive to the strength and duration of the initial policies. It is possible, under some policy assumptions, that energy systems would continue to depend on fossil fuels for so long as fossil fuels remain abundant and the least cost resource; and under other assumptions, after allowing for the unavoidable lags associated with investment and the building up of a new capital stock, that fossil fuels would become almost wholly displaced by the non-carbon alternatives. The implication is that the external benefits of innovation, which include the creation of options and the reduction of costs arising directly from innovation itself, and the reduction of environmental damage, are far greater, perhaps by orders of magnitude, than the traditional cost-benefit models used for the analysis of climate change mitigation. The analysis suggests why a focus on discovery and innovation offers a promising way forward for national and international policies on climate change.

DE Kyoto protocol; carbon dioxide emissions; fossil-energy consumption
AB There is growing interest in the utilization of unused, but possible, energy sources to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and fossil-energy consumption, and especially to comply with the Kyoto Protocol which came into effect in 2005. Detailed considerations of plant location, land use and life cycle analysis, however, have not yet been fully estimated with a view to confirming the advantages of the new energy-source usage.
   A model for heat energy from river water and treated sewage water, and waste-heat energy from municipal solid-waste incineration plants was built and applied to the Tokyo urban area in Japan, considering the spatial and time-related distribution of demands and supplies, the shapes of buildings in the demand area, and life-cycle analysis. The model selected areas were those which should use these energies without prejudice, and sometimes the areas were far from the energy-source point. The reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions resulting from new energy-sources was about 8% of the reduction target for Tokyo in 1990. The model was able to precisely evaluate the new energy-usage, using data from both supply and demand sides. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the study that led to the development of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix for the Oeiras municipality, one of the largest Portuguese municipalities, located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. This matrix takes into account the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to an increase of electricity demand in buildings as well as solid and liquid wastes treatment from the domestic and services sectors. Using emission factors that were calculated from the relationship between the electricity produced and amount of treated wastes, the GHC emissions in the Oeiras municipality were estimated for a time series of 6 yr (19982003). The obtained results showed that the electricity sector accounts for approximately 75% of the municipal emissions in 2003. This study was developed to obtain tools to base options and actions to be undertaken by local authorities such as energy planning and also public information.

ID NANOTUBES; NANOPARTICLES
AB Mesoporous carbon microfibers (MCMFs) were prepared using one-dimensional alumina microfibers as the templates via chemical vapor deposition method. Physical adsorption of nitrogen, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, field-emission transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and field-ernission scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to study the structure and morphology of the samples. MCMFs possess a core/shell structure with a surface area of 409 m(2)/g. The core structure of the obtained MCMFs was composed of mesopores with a pore size of 8.8 nm, whereas the dense shell with a thickness of around 15-20 nm was built up with roughly parallel discrete graphene layers. Compared with Pt catalyst supported on Vulcan XC-72, catalyst supported on MCMFs displayed a better CO tolerance and catalytic activity in electrooxidation of methanol at room temperature.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; INDICATORS
AB To simulate the quantitative effects of regional biomass alternatives for energetic purpose (BfE) on air pollutant emissions, a system dynamics model was developed and applied for the EuRegion Austrian-Hungarian cross-border area. The dynamic simulation program Vensim (R) was used to build an overall regional model with economic, social and environmental sectors. Within this model, the here-introduced regional air pollution sub-model (RegAir) includes the important human-made emissions of 10 pollutants resulting from all relevant source sectors within the region investigated. Emissions from activities related to biomass production, transport, conversion and final energy consumption were built in detail. After building and calibrating the RegAir model, seven quantitative test scenarios were defined and implemented into the model. Through the scenarios simulation, effects on air emissions were followed and compared over time. The results of these simulations show a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, especially in cases where fossil fuel displacement in heating devices is achieved on the largest scale. On the contrary, traditional air pollutants increase by most BfE options.
   The results of the RegAir model simulations of BfE alternatives over two decades provide useful quantifications of various air emissions and identify the less pollutant BfE alternatives in the dynamic context of the relevant air pollution sources of the region. After minor structural modifications and appropriate calibration, RegAir can be applied to other regions as well. However, it is stated that, to finally decide on the overall most-appropriate options at a regional level, other environmental as well as economic and social effects must be taken into consideration, being the latter the goal of the mentioned overall regional model which serves as a model frame to the RegAir tool.

DE low-energy residential buildings; district heating; CO2 emissions;
   supply security
AB In several housing development projects in Norway the requirements related to the mandatory connection to district heating plants have shown to be a barrier for building low-energy residential buildings. The developers have considered the costs related to both low-energy measures and a space heating system that can utilize district heat to be too high to give the project acceptable profitability. In these projects the developers wanted to use a cheaper electric space heating system. Based on models representative for the range of the Norwegian district heating plants, calculations show that the CO2 emissions related to heating in residential buildings with an energy standard in accordance with the new building regulations and that are connected to the district heating grid, are lower than for similar buildings with a low-energy standard and with heating based on electricity. However, in a long term perspective the differences are marginal when considering the national annual CO2 emissions. Similarly, increased peak power demand due to electricity-based heating may also be regarded as marginal when compared to the present maximum peak power capacity in Norway. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   emissions; overheating; embodied CO2
AB A 100-year lifecycle carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions analysis is reported for a two-bedroom, 65 m 2 floor area, semi-detached house in southeast England. How the balance between the embodied (ECO2) and operational CO2 emissions of the building are affected by the inclusion of thermal mass and the impacts of climate change is quantified. Four 'weights' of thermal mass were considered, ranging from lightweight timber frame to very heavyweight concrete construction. For each case, total ECO2 quantities were calculated and,predictions for operational CO2 emissions obtained from a 100-year dynamic thermal modelling simulation under a medium-high emissions climate change scenario for south-east England. At the start of the lifecycle, the dwellings were passively cooled in summer, but air conditioning was installed when overheating reached a certain threshold. The inclusion of thermal mass delayed the year in the lifecycle when this occurred, due to the better passive control of summertime overheating. Operational heating and cooling energy needs were also found to decrease with increasing thermal mass due to the beneficial effects of fabric energy storage. The calculated initial ECO2 was higher in the heavier weight cases, by up to 15% (4.93 t) of the lightweight case value, but these difference were offset early in the lifecycle due to the savings in operational CO2 emissions, with total savings of up to 17% (35.7 t) in lifecycle CO2 found for the heaviest weight case.

TI Estimating local greenhouse gas emissions - A case study on a Portuguese
   municipality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE greenhouse gases emissions; emission matrix; energy; wastes
AB This paper describes the study that led to the development of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix for the Oeiras municipality, one of the largest Portuguese municipalities, located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. This matrix takes into account the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, due to an increase of electricity demand in buildings as well as solid and liquid wastes treatment, from the domestic and services sectors.
   Using emission factors that were calculated from the relationship between the electricity produced and amount of treated wastes, the GHG emissions in the Oeiras municipality, were estimated for a time series of 6 years (1998-2003).
   The obtained results showed that the electricity sector accounts for about 75% of the municipal emissions in 2003. This study was developed in order to obtain tools to base options and actions to be undertaken by local authorities such as energy planning and also public information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Carbon Neutrality at the Local Level: Achievable Goal or Fantasy?
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
DE greenhouse gas mitigation; suburban activity centers; cost-effectiveness
   evaluation; campus planning
AB Problem: Suburban areas have an important role to play in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet little is known about the magnitude of reductions that can be expected or which strategies are most promising. Local GHG reduction strategies are often capital investments such as new green buildings, ignoring the promise of operational strategies. Purpose: The research is intended to support local planning efforts for GHG reduction in areas where land uses are separated and transit use is low. It is also intended to contribute to the dialogue on the potential for local actions versus broader state, federal, or international initiatives. Methods: Using the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP) campus in eastern Los Angeles County as a case study, this ex ante evaluation estimates the cost effectiveness of eight capital and operating GHG-reduction strategies. It uses locally developed estimation methods in combination with the Clean Air-Cool Planet GHG inventory model. Results and conclusions: Carbon neutrality in suburban areas is a fantasy unless there are supportive energy, transportation, and carbon sequestration initiatives at the state, national, and international level. We find that local operational strategies, such as online classes and alternative scheduling, green energy purchase, and parking pricing and carpool programs have merit. Greater results are achieved when operational strategies are combined with cost-effective capital investments such as land use mixing (in this case, on-campus housing). Even so, some of the most favored capital approaches, such as a new green building or building commuter rail transit station facilities, rank near the bottom in cost effectiveness. Takeaway for practice: Given the urgency of reducing GHG emissions, local planners and activity center managers should evaluate both capital and operating strategies and implement the most cost-effective strategies in new and existing development. Research support: Support for this research was provided by the President's Office, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

TI Bioenergy transition in rural China: Policy options and co-benefits

LA English
DT Article
DE bioenergy; sustainable rural development; China
ID ENERGY DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper reviews the current situation of bioenergy development in China, particularly oil its relationship to sustainable rural development. It argues that the current government strategy, investment policy and industrial interest are over-emphasized on biomass-burning power generation as part of the clean energy development trajectories, which may not lead to the most cost-effective outcomes in terms of investments, resource use and social development objectives. It points out that there are large potentials in developing and disseminating household-based biomass technologies in rural areas, especially with energy-efficient modern biomass stoves, which can produce far more economic, social and environmental benefits than biomass power plants. It is a decentralized solution to use renewable energy resources for meeting multi-objectives. It is suggested that key incentive policies be provided by the government to encourage this technological transition, or the leapfrogging from using traditional household stoves towards modern biomass stoves, which will lead to a win-win situation in global, regional and local environmental protection, sustainable resource management and related social benefits, particularly for the poor in remote communities. Six policy recommendations are made: (1) financial schemes development; (2) preferable tax and carbon tax; (3) regulatory policy reform; (4) service industry support; (5) market research, training and capacity building for key stakeholders; (6) development of methodologies and standards for CDM projects. The potential co-benefits brought Lip by this massive biomass technology transition will bring new perspectives to realizing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and global CO2 emissions reduction targets in China, and also set an example to other developing countries.

TI Evaluating the scope for energy-efficiency improvements in the public

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy; benchmark; healthcare buildings
AB The National Health Service in Scotland (NHSScotland) has, in recent years, done much to reduce energy consumption in its major healthcare buildings (hospitals). On average, a reduction of 2% per year has been achieved since 2000, based on hospital buildings. However, there had been little or no attention paid to smaller premises such as health centres, clinics, dentists, etc. Such smaller healthcare buildings in Scotland constitute 29% of the total treated floor area of all NHSScotland buildings and, therefore, may contribute a similar percentage of carbon and other emissions to the environment. By concentrating on a sample of local health centres in Scotland, this paper outlines the creation of an energy benchmark target, which is part of a wider research project to investigate the environmental impacts of small healthcare buildings in Scotland and the scope for improvements. It was found that energy consumption varied widely between different centres but this variation could not be linked to building style, floor area or volume. Overall, it was found that a benchmark of 0.2 GJ/m(3) would be challenging, but realistic. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE micro-CHP; domestic sector; energy efficiency; CO2 savings
AB This paper considers the relationship between heat-saving and micro-combined heat and power (mu CHP) technological interventions for reducing the carbon footprint of existing domestic dwellings within the UK housing stock. The relationship between the annual heat requirement of individual dwellings and the CO2 savings attributable to different mu CHP systems is investigated (by means of predictive modelling based oil heat and power demand datasets recorded oil a 1-min time base for nine dwellings). An assessment is made of the effects of various heat-saving measures upon the annual CO2 savings predictions for candidate mu CHP system implementations, when applied to 'domestic building variants' (as defined within the Carbon Vision TARBASE research programme). The increasing application of heat-saving interventions serves to reduce the CO2 savings solely attributable to a mu CHP system. The magnitude of this effect is a function of the mu CHP system's electrical efficiency and electrical power output. For example, a 1 kW prime mover of 10% electrical efficiency is predicted to reduce annual CO2 emissions by 72 kg CO2 for a dwelling with all annual heat requirement of 11.9 MWh, but if the identified set of heat-saving measures is implemented first the demand falls to 5.0 MWh and the mu CHP system will actually result in all emissions increase of 100 kg CO2 p.a. By comparison, relative savings of 467 and 294 kgCO(2) p.a. are predicted if this dwelling is fitted with a 1 kW prime mover of 30% electrical efficiency. Still greater savings are predicted for higher power output systems of high efficiency, but a relatively large proportion of the generated electricity (44-75% depending oil the heat and electrical demand of the dwelling) must then be exported.

AB The paper analyzes how to comply with an emission constraint, which restricts the use of an established energy technique, given the two options to save energy and to invest in two alternative energy techniques. These techniques differ in their deterioration rates and the investment lags of the corresponding capital stocks. Thus, the paper takes a medium-term perspective on climate change mitigation, where the time horizon is too short for technological change to occur, but long enough for capital stocks to accumulate and deteriorate. It is shown that, in general, only one of the two alternative techniques prevails in the stationary state, although, both techniques might be utilized during the transition phase. Hence, while in a static economy only one technique is efficient, this is not necessarily true in a dynamic economy.

AB US residential and commercial buildings were responsible for about 41 exajoules (EJ) of primary energy use per year in 2002, accounting for approximately 9% of the world fossil-fuel related anthropogenic carbon (C) emissions of 6.7 Gt that contribute to climate change. US Government-sponsored building energy efficiency research and implementation programs are focused on reducing energy consumption in US residential and commercial buildings and reducing these carbon (C) emissions. Although not specifically intended for adaptation to a warmer climate and less effective than under today's cooler climate, these programs also could help reduce energy demand in a future warmer world. Warming scenarios projected by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 imply net overall decreases in both site energy and primary energy consumption in US residential and commercial buildings, largely because of the reduced need for heating. However, there would be as much as a 25% increase in building space cooling demand and a significant part of the increase could be offset by energy-efficiency improvements in buildings. Overall, in the US, buildings-related energy efficiency programs would reduce site energy consumption in buildings in the US by more than 2 EJ in 2020 and primary energy by more than 3.5 EJ, more than enough to offset the projected growth in cooling energy consumption due to climate change and growth in the US building stock. The savings would have an estimated annual net value at 2005 energy prices of between $45.0 and $47.3 billion to consumers.

DE domestic energy analysis; statistical modelling; cluster analysis
AB The ability to predict how changes in patterns of usage in different types of dwelling can affect energy consumption is important if efforts to reduce demand and carbon emissions are to be effective. This paper describes an approach using a questionnaire survey, supported by annual gas and electricity meter data and floor-area estimates derived from a GIS. Clusters of higher and lower energy consumers were discovered and these were related to indicators of energy consumption. Simple and multiple regression were used to determine the strength of the relationships and identify the most statistically-significant indicators of differences in gas and electricity consumption. Although significant effects of the built-form type were not observable in the data available, the effects of related measurable and countable aspects of form, such as floor-area and numbers of rooms, were seen. Significant relationships were found with the number of bedrooms and regular home working, which may reflect changes in UK households that are expected to drive future energy-consumption. Implications for zonal domestic energy-models are noted. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background, aim, and scope Large quantities of biosolids (sewage sludge), which are produced from municipal wastewater treatment, are ever-increasing because of the commissioning of new treatment plants and continuous upgrades of the existing facilities. A large proportion of biosolids are currently landfilled. With increasing pressure from regulators and the general public, landfilling of biosolids is being phased out in many countries because of potential secondary pollution caused by leachate and the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Biosolids contain nutrients and energy that can be used beneficially. Significant efforts have been made recently to develop new technologies to manage biosolids and make useful products from them. In this paper, we provide a review of the technologies in biosolids management.
   Materials and methods A survey of literature was conducted.
   Results At present, the most common beneficial use of biosolids is agricultural land application because of inherent fertilizer values found in biosolids. Expansion of land application, however, may be limited in the future because of more stringent regulatory requirements and public concern about food chain contamination in some countries. Perceived as a green energy source, the combustion of biosolids has received renewed interest. Anaerobic digestion is generally a more effective method than incineration for energy recovery, and digested biosolids are suitable for further beneficial use through land application. Although conventional incineration systems for biosolid management generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in the biosolids, it is expected that more combustion systems, either monocombustion or cocombustion, will be built to cope with the increasing quantity of biosolids.
   Discussion Under the increasingly popular low-carbon economy policy, biosolids may be recognized as a renewable fuel and be eligible for 'carbon credits'. Because ash can be used to manufacture construction materials, combustion can provide a complete management for biosolids. A number of advanced thermal conversion technologies (e.g., supercritical water oxidation process and pyrolysis) are under development for biosolids management with a goal to generate useful products, such as higher quality fuels and recovery of phosphorus. With an ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, growing bioenergy crops and forests using biosolids as a fertilizer and soil amendment can not only contribute to the low-carbon economy but also maximize the nutrient and carbon value of the biosolids.
   Conclusions Land application of biosolids achieves a complete reuse of its nutrients and organic carbon at a relatively low cost. Therefore, land application should become a preferred management option where there is available land, the quality of biosolids meet regulatory requirements, and it is socially acceptable. Intensive energy cropping and forest production using biosolids can help us meet the ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, which can eliminate the contamination potential for food sources, a common social concern about land application of biosolids. In recent years, increasing numbers of national and local governments have adopted more stringent regulations toward biosolid management. Under such a political climate, biosolids producers will have to develop multireuse strategies for biosolids to avoid being caught because a single route management practice might be under pressure at a short notice. Conventional incineration systems for biosolids management generally consume more energy than they produce and, although by-products may be used in manufacturing, this process cannot be regarded as a beneficial use of biosolids. However, biosolids are likely to become a source of renewable energy and produce 'carbon credits' under the increasingly popular, low-carbon economy policy.
   Recommendations and perspectives To manage biosolids in a sustainable manner, there is a need for further research in the following areas: achieving a higher degree of public understanding and acceptance for the beneficial use of biosolids, developing cost-efficient and effective thermal conversions for direct energy recovery from biosolids, advancing technology for phosphorus recovery, and selecting or breeding crops for efficient biofuel production.

TI THE LEAP TO ZERO CARBON AND ZERO EMISSIONS: Understanding How to Go
   Beyond Existing Sustainable Design Protocols
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB The greening of North American building seems to be taking hold. The intended market transformation of the LEED (TM) Certification system appears to be working. Statistics show that the numbers of certified green buildings in both the United States and Canada are increasing at an exponential rate. The proposed changes to the USGBC version of LEED (TM)-2009/V.3-are intended to support changes in the system that recognize differences in credit values as well as regionalized differences in the required approach to green building. The introduction of LEED (TM) for Homes and Neighborhoods has extended the potential influence of the program beyond the original commercial building marketing target. ASHRAE's proposed Standard 189.1 is also taking aim at increasing the standards for high performance Buildings of a non low-rise residential variety.
   However, with continuing environmental degradation, and more recent escalating concerns about global warming and CO(2) levels in the environment, it is becoming clear that even the highest standards of construction that are being implemented in North America today are simply not enough. While the design and construction industries in the United States and Canada scramble to adopt and evolve green building guidelines such as LEED (TM) to increase their rigor and range of applicability, the United Kingdom is advancing in the implementation of regulations that are specifically intended to control carbon emissions, and not just for commercial buildings.
   Great Britain has already adopted policies that require all new housing stock to be carbon neutral by the year 2016. They are working towards the implementation of carbon taxes to motivate companies to look closely at the way that they consume energy and goods, and reward citizens that show initiative in responding to this crisis. The act of carbon counting is beginning to permeate a multitude of sectors in the UK.
   The issue of carbon is not a simple one. There is carbon involved in the extraction of the resources that we use to create products; in the transportation of these products to the site; in the physical construction of the buildings; in the operation of buildings; and in the lives of people as they carry on business. In order to be able to reach a state of "carbon neutrality,"lifestyle changes will be necessary. The status quo cannot be simply modified to reduce its carbon cost. Consumption patterns must change. Buildings and their programs may require downsizing or creative reinvention. Understanding the definitions of the terms that are associated with this elevated movement is important.
   This article will examine the means by which to understand the potential of ratcheting up the performance requirements of existing North American green protocols to achieve carbon neutral standards, as well as how to interpret and extend existing assessment criteria to highlight and include carbon neutral interests.

DE Carbon Dioxide Emission Reduction; Photovoltaics; Water Heater; Thermal
   Insulation; Tree Shade Effect
AB Japan signed the Kyoto Protocol to reduce the nation's carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 6% below the 1990 level. The housing industry is no exception being required to reduce the negative impact of the housing delivery on the environment. Today, all newly-constructed detached houses being built by Sekisui House Ltd. are designed to alleviate the societal pressure, accompanied basically with the following techniques and/or technologies: (1) the reduction of energy use relating to air-conditioning by improving the houses' insulation performance to meet Japan's energy saving standard set in 1999, as well as ventilation by making use of a passive ventilation system driven by stock effect; (2) the reduction of energy consumption that derives from domestic hot water by applying a high-efficient water heater, where the system performance is improved from 80% to 95% of the efficiency-today, Japanese housing manufacturers also tend to promote the installation of a gas engine cogeneration system and air-source heat pump water heater in housing; (3) the micro-power generation by the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation system; and (4) the cooling effect achieved by tree shading, which helps lower the ambient temperature around buildings during the summer. The company's Action Plan 20' reflects the global warming prevention (or CO2 emission reduction) strategy, considered to be effective in the delivery of low-carbon housing in Japan.

DE Sudan; energy potential; environment; future prospect
AB The harsh climate in Sudan presents unique challenges in meeting growing demands for power and water. The international demand of water increases compared to the available water resources, due to recent development water resources for different uses. In many areas especially in Red Sea areas, there is serious a shortage of potable water. These areas are enjoyed with a high intensity of solar energy. The move towards a de-carbonised world, driven partly by climate science and partly by the business opportunities it offers, will need the promotion of environmentally friendly alternatives, if an acceptable stabilisation level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is to be achieved. This requires the harnessing and use of natural resources that produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases and provides comfortable coexistence of human, livestock, and plants. This study reviews the energy-using technologies based on natural resources, which are available to and applicable in the farming industry. Among these are greenhouses, which are necessary for the growth of some plants (i.e., vegetables, flowers, etc.), in severe climates. Globally, buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of the total world annual energy consumption. Most of this energy is for the provision of lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of CO, and NO, emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies. Under the 1997 Montreal Protocol, governments agreed to phase out chemicals used as refrigerants that have the potential to destroy stratospheric ozone. It was therefore considered desirable to reduce energy consumption and decrease the rate of depletion of world energy reserves and pollution of the environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID COOLING SYSTEM
AB Air conditioning (AC) is spreading in Spain, where summer weather reaches temperatures above 35 degrees C. This causes the increase, not only of electricity consumption, but also organic refrigerant leakage due to the use of vapour-compression machines.
   An experimental research on solar absorption cooling has been carried out at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) in order to evaluate alternative lower impact AC techniques. The facility is based on an on-Campus field of 50 m(2) flat plate solar collectors driving a single-effect commercial LiBr/H2O absorption machine through a hot-water storage tank.
   Experimental operating parameters have been recorded during 2004 summer season in periods of 10 min showing all the relevant figures of merit.
   Results show that absorption machine cooling power reaches 6-10 kW, with a generator driving power input of 10-15 kW, achieving a mean cooling period of 6.5 h of complete solar autonomy on a seasonal average day.
   In order to measure the market applicability of this setup, the instantaneous thermal load and demand of a single detached housing of total floorspace of 90 m(2) were calculated using standard techniques. Its peak ranged from 6 to 8 kW. Seasonal solar fraction of AC provided by the facility reached 56%.
   This work shows results on system performance, economic investing, energy and economic savings and includes environmental impact reduction, when comparing the solar absorption system with a conventional vapour-compression machine. A sensitivity study to solar field size has been performed to yield the reasonable share of the absorption machine in the seasonal cooling demand. The result indicates that the dimensioning of the facility is correct. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Technologies to achieve demand reduction and microgeneration in

DE Demand reduction; Low- and zero-carbon technologies; Rebound effect
AB Buildings account for almost half of UK carbon dioxide emissions, and energy demand in buildings continues to grow. In the context of economic growth, population growth, increasing demand for homes and commercial floor space, and increasing demand for energy services, energy use and probably carbon emissions look set to continue to increase unless there is significant change. This paper outlines enabling technologies that may permit a step-change reduction in energy demand from buildings through the application of next-generation information metering and control, energy-efficiency products and microgeneration. it covers both residential and non-residential buildings. This wide approach has been adopted because technologies and trends tend to migrate from one building sector to another, as, for example, IT has moved from offices into homes and lighting trends from offices and retail into homes. It covers technologies that can be used in new build or major refurbishment. Much of the need for change involves the better use of known technology, and some involves changing behaviour. Some behaviour depends on new technologies such as metering. Understanding how technological innovations are taken up (e.g. stock turnover issues, as well as how technical change occurs) and the economics of new technologies is as important as the technologies themselves.

TI Does demolition or refurbishment of old and inefficient homes help to
   increase our environmental, social and economic viability?
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Urban regeneration; Sustainable communities; Embodied energy
AB The issue of whether to demolish or refurbish older housing has been debated for over a century. It has been an active policy area since the late 1880s, when the Government first authorised the statutory demolition of insanitary slums. In the 1960s, revulsion at the scale of 'demolition blight' and new building caused a rethink, leading to a major reinvestment in inner city neighbourboods of older housing. In the past 5 years, debate on demolition and new building has been intensified by the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan of 2003, with its proposals for large-scale clearance and building. Environmental arguments about renovating the existing stock have gained increasing prominence as people have sought to defend their communities from demolition.
   The evidence on whether demolition would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is unclear and disputed. This paper summarises the evidence and arguments, and attempts to clarify the most realistic, achievable route to major reductions in energy use in homes. The arguments that apply to housing also apply to most other buildings and therefore to the overall built environment, which accounts for half of all carbon emissions.
   Three main sources of evidence have helped in the development of this paper, but there are many other studies we draw on in the discussion.
   Firstly, the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University has argued that around three million demolitions are necessary by 2050 if we are to reach the stringent energy reduction targets that will be required in our housing stock [Boardman et al., 2005. 40% House. Environmental Change Institute, Oxford]. Its demolition figure is based on complex modelling that with small modifications can produce very different numbers. Its assessment does not take account of the embodied carbon costs such as volume of new materials, energy use in producing concrete, steel and other structural and infrastructural elements, and other factors affecting the environment Such as land use, infrastructure and area blighting. We discuss these issues in order to clarify the scale of the challenge and the relative value of demolition or renovation.
   Secondly, the Sustainable Development Commission JSDC, 2006. 'Stock Take': Delivering improvements in existing housing. Sustainable Development Commission, London] argues the urgent need to upgrade the existing stock on the grounds that 70% of all homes that will exist in 2050, even with the ambitious new building programme now announced, are already built. The maximum feasible demolition of two million existing homes by 2050, based on experience to date, suggests that under 10% of the current stock will have been demolished by then. We argue that upgrading this stock to high environmental standards can actually be achieved more cheaply than demolishing it, and with as significant a carbon reduction.
   Thirdly, the German Federal Housing, Urban and Transport Ministry has announced an ambitious energy reduction programme that will upgrade all pre-1984 homes in Germany by 2020, an estimated 30 million units.' This is based on evidence from several CO(2) reduction programmes since 1996, showing the feasibility of upgrading. An 80% cut in energy use has been achieved, making the performance of the renovated homes at least as good as Germany's current exacting new build standards. The evidence from Germany is more grounded than any that has so far been produced in the UK, as it is based on several thousand examples.
   The paper also discusses the social and political problems of demolition. There is widespread opposition to large-scale demolition of older stock, mainly pre-1919 terraced homes, which is currently the most 'leaky'. This older property is a prime target for demolition in the Environmental Change Institute's proposals and the Government's plans.
   The environmental benefits of refurbishment are shown, based on work by the Empty Homes Agency, evidence from English Heritage, the Building Research Establishment and the Prince's Foundation. Work on refurbishment shows that existing homes, often in brick-built terraces, are relatively easy to upgrade and, with careful reinvestment in the existing buildings, can achieve as high environmental efficiency standards as current new build.
   We consider major social, economic and environmental benefits of refurbishment compared with demolition, including: a reduction in the transport costs, reduced landfill disposal, greater reuse of materials, reuse of infill sites and existing infrastructure, reduced new building on flood plains, local economic development, retention of community infrastructure, neighbourhood renewal and management. We weigh these benefits against the full costs of demolition and rebuilding, involving much higher capital costs, higher material wastage, greater embodied carbon inputs, the polluting impact of particulates, greater use of lorry transport for materials and waste, greater use of aggregates, more noise and disruption. On the social issues of housing need and fuel poverty, we argue that refurbishment and infill building are socially more acceptable, cheaper and create far lower environmental impact, while reducing fuel poverty. The incentive problems associated with renovation and the barriers to delivering it are also discussed.
   The evidence we have uncovered counters the suggestion that large-scale and accelerated demolition would either help us meet our energy and climate change targets or respond to our social needs. Many arguments remain unclear, but the overall balance of evidence suggests that refurbishment most often makes sense on the basis of time, cost, community impact, prevention of sprawl, reuse of existing infrastructure and protection of existing communities. It can also lead to reduced energy use in buildings in both the short and long term.
   Many factors will influence what happens in practice, but it seems unlikely under any scenario that the rate of demolition will accelerate far above current levels. Upgrading the existing stock is likely to gain in significance for environmental, social and economic reasons. Adopting policies that aid the retention and upgrading of the existing stock will help develop the necessary skills and technologies, save materials and land, and enhance the integration of existing communities in need of regeneration.

AB New buildings will have to be designed to cope with the effects of climate change. These include warmer weather in which keeping cool will be important, more extreme and wet weather, and increased subsidence risk. Flood risk areas will increase, requiring measures for both resistance for initial protection and resilience for rapid recovering.
   At the same time, new buildings must use less fossil fuel in a low or zero-carbon world. Homes, offices, schools and other buildings will need to maximise passive measures of more effective insulation, improved airtightness and greater thermal mass, They will also need to make more use of solar energy and other renewable inputs. New buildings will incorporate a range of new technologies to reduce their energy use, and to cut the energy needed to build them, including the embodied energy in the materials they contain.

AB Greater potential energy savings can be achieved in the large stock of existing dwellings than in the relatively small proportion of newly built dwellings. Although the energy performance of existing dwellings is much poorer than new dwellings, the stock of existing dwellings is very large in a 'mature' built environment of most developed countries. In the past decade, awareness of the potential energy savings has spread widely among the many stakeholders involved. Nonetheless, most regulations and instruments are still aimed at achieving sustainable newly built construction. An evidenced-based overview of the current state of the residential building stock is provided for eight northern European countries along with current renovation data. Comparisons are made on the characteristics, physical quality and developments of the residential building stock. Existing policies and incentives to reduce energy use and CO2 emissions are analysed for their impacts on the existing building stock as well as the barriers preventing successful sustainable renovation. Common denominators in the current state of renovation of residential building stock are used to identify possible future instruments and incentives that are needed to overcome current barriers.

AB A conceptual framework and methodological approach are developed to understand the potential linkage between urban domestic heat demand and the heatwave vulnerability index, using the London building stock as a case study. A geographic information system (GIS)-based systematic approach towards exploring the impact of the urban built form and the heat island phenomenon on domestic space heating needs and heat-related mortality is demonstrated. The physical properties of individual dwellings were inferred from existing GIS databases as a function of given attributes (such as the form and age of the property). Localized annual heating degree-days (HDD) across London were predicted using a site-specific model. Each dwelling was modelled using a modified version of the steady-state annual domestic energy model. The energy consumption profiles generated were subsequently compared with existing top-down regional energy statistics. In addition, local environmental factors such as built density, green coverage ratio, and land surface temperature were extracted from a combination of GIS and satellite image data sources. By mapping these factors across the Greater London Area, their influence on the risk of heat death during the 2006 heatwave was examined. The model could potentially be utilized to inform urban-scale policies relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the identification of heat-vulnerable population groups across London.

AB Today's existing building stocks are major energy consumers and CO2 emitters, depending on various factors including urban morphology, architectural archetypes, construction technologies, energy systems, and inhabitant behaviour. A large case study based on 96 000 buildings in Paris, France, is the subject of detailed analysis of the existing residential building stock by comparing some environmental metrics of Paris's urban fabric with thermal energy consumption in buildings. The environmental metrics, such as building shape factor and passive volume (for natural ventilation and daylighting), are functions of urban morphology. This comparison of urban forms and heating energy consumption reveals some impacts of urban morphology and building typology on the energy efficiency in the different zones of Paris. The energy efficiency and CO2 emissions related to heating mode and inhabitant behaviour are separated from those linked to urban form and construction technology. Thus, a balanced view of the complex impacts of morphologies, typologies, energy systems, and inhabitant behaviour on energy loads and CO2 emissions is presented, which allows for the optimization of urban form in terms of density, building configuration, and morphology. Similar large-scale simulations can analyse urban form and the mix of building stock as well as the interaction of increased equipment efficiency, alternative energy mix, and inhabitant behaviour.

   mitigation
AB Thermal Energy Storage (TES) provides us with a flexible heating and/or cooling tool to combat global warming through conserving energy while utilising natural renewable energy resources. This paper aims to show how CO2 emissions can be decreased by utilising different TES concepts in Turkey. The first project is for the heating and cooling of a supermarket using Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) in Mersin. With a 60% higher Coefficient of Performance (COP), the yearly CO2 emissions reduction contribution of this project is 113 tonnes. The second project concerns ATES for the heating and cooling of a greenhouse in Adana. The greenhouse was used as a 'solar collector' and source of energy for the ATES system. No fossil fuels were consumed for heating the greenhouse and cooling was made possible with the ATES system. Energy conservation amounted to 68% and CO2 emissions were reduced by 26 tonnes/year. The third one is a pilot project using TES in microencapsulated phase change materials in a test cabin in Adana with a floor area of 4 m(2). By using a 3.5 kg Phase Change Material (PCM) together with insulation panels in the test cabin, 7% cooling energy and 28% heating energy can be conserved. The corresponding CO2 emissions reduction would be 0.5 tonnes/year.

AB The energy demand of the hotel sector of an Italian region is here utilized for hierarchizing, by means of an empirical method, efficient measures devoted to energy saving and reduction of CO2 emissions. Due to the large number of consumers present in the selected territorial area and the lack in detailed data, the energy demand assessment is here carried out by the analysis of a sample of representative consumers.
   A short set of indexes, referring to energy and environmental performances, are defined and calculated for different clusters of hotels, grouped on the basis of site characteristics, opening periods, number of beds, and building age. Such indexes are utilized to establish lists of actions with assigned priorities stemming from energy, environmental and economics issues.
   Energy planners and decision makers can easily use this approach for defining, implementing and monitoring energy efficiency as well as sustainability policies in the tourist sector of a given geographical area, starting from a limited set of data. The method has been proposed by authors within the assessment of the Sicilian Energy Masterplan. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI GREENING THE UK BUILDING STOCK: Historic Trends and Low Carbon Futures
   1970-2050
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE CANADIAN SOCIETY FOR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGIES
AB Historic trends and future projections of energy use and carbon dioxide emissions associated with the United Kingdom building stock are analysed for the period 1970-2050. Energy use in housing is found to rise at a slightly slower rate than the increase in household numbers, which totalled some 25.5 million in 2000. It appears feasible to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the UK domestic building stock by more than 65% by 2050. But this would require a significant take-up of energy saving measures and the adoption of various low or zero carbon (LZC) energy technologies. Non-domestic buildings consisted of some 1.98 million premises in 2000. Anticipated changes in the UK Building Regulations will lead to reductions in energy use and carbon emissions of up to 17% and 12% respectively for 2010 standard buildings. Improvements in the non-domestic building stock and industrial processing could lead to a reduction of nearly 59% in CO2 emissions, via the adoption of LZC energy technologies. Thus, the potential for 'greening' the UK building stock - making it environmentally benign - is large, but the measures needed to achieve this would present a significant challenge to the UK government, domestic householders, and industry in the broadest sense.

AB House envelope measures and conversion of heating systems can reduce primary energy use and CO2 emission in the existing Swedish building stock. We analysed how the size and construction of electrically heated detached houses affect the potential for such measures and the potential for cogenerated district heating. Our starting point was two typical houses built in the 1970s. We altered the floor plans to obtain 6 houses, with heated floor space ranging between 100 and 306 m(2). One of the houses was also analysed for three energy standards with differing heat loss rates. CO2 emission, primary energy use and heating cost were estimated after implementing house envelope measures, conversions to other heating systems and changes in the generation of district heat and electricity. The study accounted for primary energy, including energy chains from natural resources to useful heat in the houses. We showed that conversion to district heating based on biomass, together with house envelope measures, reduced the primary energy use by 88% and the CO2 emission by 96%, while reducing the annual societal cost by 7%. The choice of end-use heating system was decisive for the primary energy use, with district hearing being the most efficient. Neither house size nor energy standard did significantly change the ranking of the heating systems, either from a primary energy or an economic viewpoint, but did affect the extent of the annual cost reduction after implementing the measures.

ID EMISSION REDUCTIONS; HOUSING STOCK; 60-PERCENT
AB The UK government has set a groundbreaking target of a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. Scenario and modelling assessment of this stringent target consistently finds that all sectors need to contribute to emissions reductions. The UK residential sector accounts for around 30% of the total final energy use and more than one-quarter of CO2 emissions. This paper focuses on modelling of the residential sector in a system wide energy-economy models (UK MARKAL) and key UK sectoral housing stock models. The UK residential energy demand and CO2 emission from the both approaches are compared. In an energy system with 60% economy-wide CO2 reductions, the residential sector plays a commensurate role. Energy systems analysis finds this reduction is primarily driven by energy systems interactions notably decarbonisation of the power sector combined with increased appliance efficiency. The stock models find alternate decarbonisation pathways based on assumptions related to the future building stock and behavioural changes. The paper concludes with a discussion on the assumptions and drivers of emission reductions in different models of the residential energy sector. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Climate Stabilization Wedges in Action: A Systems Approach to Energy
   Sustainability for Hawaii Island
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID CO2 EMISSIONS; TECHNOLOGIES
AB Pacala and Socolow developed a framework to stabilize global greenhouse gas levels for the next fifty years using wedges of constant size representing an increasing use of existing technologies and approaches for energy efficiency, carbon free generation, renewables, and carbon storage. The research presented here applies their approach to Hawaii Island, with modifications to support local scale analysis and employing a "bottom-up" methodology that allows for wedges of various sizes. A discretely bounded spatial unit offers a testing ground for a holistic approach to improving the energy sector with the identification of local options and limitations to the implementation of a comprehensive energy strategy. Nearly 80% of total primary energy demand across all sectors for Hawaii Island is currently met using petroleum-based fuels. The Sustainable Energy Plan scenario included here presents an internally consistent set of recommendations bounded by local constraints in areas such as transportation efficiency, centralized renewable generation (e.g., geothermal, wind), reduction in transmission losses, and improved building efficiency. This scenario shows that the demand for primary energy in 2030 could be reduced by 23% through efficiency measures while 46% could be met by renewable generation, resulting in only 31% of the projected demand being met by fossil fuels. In 2030, the annual releases of greenhouse gases would be 3.2 Mt CO(2)-eq/year under the Baseline scenario, while the Sustainable Energy Plan would reduce this to 1.2 Mt CO(2) eq/year-an annual emissions rate 40% below 2006 levels and 10% below 1990 levels. The total for greenhouse gas emissions during the 24-year study period (2007 to 2030) is 59.9 Mt CO(2)-eq under the Baseline scenario and 32.5 Mt CO(2)-eq under the Sustainable Energy Plan scenario. Numerous combinations of efficiency and renewable energy options can be employed in a manner that stabilizes the greenhouse gas emissions of Hawaii Island.

AB This study presents ail analysis of the technical and financial viability of grid-only, RES-only and grid/RES hybrid power supply configurations for a large-scale grid-connected hotel (over 100 beds). Assessment criteria comprised net present cost (NPC), renewable fraction (RF) and payback time. The RES software HOMER (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US) was utilised as the assessment tool with modeling performed with hourly load data input from a hotel located in a Subtropical coastal area of Queensland, Australia. The results demonstrate that RES, in principle, has the potential to Supply significant power for a large-scale tourist accommodation, in conjunction with the grid-electricity supply. Optimisation modeling demonstrated that, at 2004 prices, the NPC of the grid/RES hybrid configuration is comparable with the grid-only supply and resulted in a RF of 73%, a payback time of 14 years and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 65%. Optimisation modeling also showed that whilst a RES-only configuration can potentially supply 100% of power demand, such a configuration is presently uneconomical given Current electricity costs. Results indicate that wind energy conversion systems (WECS), rather than photovoltaics, are the most economically viable RES technology for large-scale grid-connected operations. Specifically, large-scale WECS (over 1000 kW) are more efficient and more economical than multiple small-scale WECS (0.1-100 kW). Hydrogen fuel cells and storage are presently uneconomical in grid-connected configurations. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that operations that rely on grid-only supply are more economically susceptible to escalations in electricity costs and the imposition of carbon taxes, in comparison to grid/RES hybrids. Indeed, at present electricity prices, which have nearly quadrupled since 2004, the grid/RES hybrid is more economical over a 20-year span than the grid-only system, with a NPC which is 50% lower, and a payback time of 4.5 years. The analysis demonstrates that RES is both technically feasible and economically viable as ail addition to grid-connected supply for large-scale tourist operations, and should become more attractive as costs of conventional supplies increase.

AB One third of the total housing stock in the Republic of Ireland has been built in 10 years up to and including 2006 and of this approximately 34% was built in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). Much of the housing was low-density with poor public transport links leading to doubts over its sustainability-particularly in terms of energy use. Although the country is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012, by 2005, emissions were already 25.4% higher than the baseline and current projections are that this figure will rise to 37% over the period. The residential sector is estimated to contribute to approximately 24.5% of energy-related CO(2) emissions. This paper estimates total emissions from residential developments in the GDA constructed between 1997 and 2006.
   Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)) emissions are estimated using a life cycle assessment approach over a 100-year building lifespan and employing process, input-output and hybrid energy techniques. Life cycle stages include: construction, operation, transport, maintenance and demolition. The main data sources include: national population and industry census data, household travel survey data, residential energy performance surveys and national accounts. The GDA was split into four zones each encompassing development at increasing radii from Dublin's city centre, namely: city centre, suburbs, exurbs and commuter towns.
   Per capita CO(2) life cycle emissions in the GDA were found to be approximately 50-55% greater in the exurbs and commuter towns than in the city centre. Of the five life cycle stages studied, operational energy requirements (predominantly space heating and hot water, but including power) contributed most significantly to emissions (68%), followed by transport (17%), construction (9%) and maintenance/renovation (6%).
   Operating emissions from dwellings in the commuter town and extra-urban zones were almost twice those in the city centre both due to larger dwelling sizes and the predominance of detached and semi-detached dwellings (with large amounts of exposed walls) in the former and the prevalence of smaller apartments in the latter. Car use was most pronounced in the zones furthest from the city centre where per capita emissions were almost twice those of residents in the city centre. Despite their smaller size, the per capita construction CO(2) emissions of apartments were approximately one third greater than for low-rise dwellings due to the greater energy intensity of the structure. However, this difference was more than compensated for by the significantly lower operational emissions referred to above.
   In 2006, recurrent CO(2) emissions (operational, transport and maintenance) from dwellings built in the GDA over the ten preceding years were 2,108 kt while construction-related emissions in that year were 1,325 kt giving a total contribution from the residential sector of 3,434 kt CO(2)/annum-representing 4.9% of national emissions for that year. Had the development policy prescribed 'city centre'-type development and transport modes, then emissions for the year 2006 would have been 2,892 kt CO(2)-a reduction of almost 16% over the actual figure. However, in this scenario recurrent emissions would have been reduced to 1,417 kt CO(2)-a reduction of 33% over actual levels.
   This study supports Irish and international governments' policies aimed at curbing CO(2) emissions from the domestic sector which focus primarily on reducing operational emissions from new and existing housing through design and construction improvements. However, it demonstrates that significant reductions in operational emissions are associated with high-density residential development with modest floor areas. Furthermore, it highlights the scope for transport emissions' reductions through better spatial planning leading to reduced car travel.

AB A ground-source heat Pump (GSHP) model is formulated and used to estimate the potential of a domestic GSHP as a carbon-saving technology (compared to a conventional gas boiler) with actual thermal data for a dwelling in the UK. The model shows good agreement with current sizing guidelines but Shows possible barriers to the carbon-savings (and running cost savings) of GSHPs. This includes an analysis of output temperatures, system sizes and grid CO(2) intensity. The model suggests that GSHPs should be aimed towards a new-build market (rather than retrofit) due to the likely reliance oil high Surface area/low temperature distribution systems. Also, grid CO(2) intensity needs to be better understood when estimating the electrical consumption CO(2) emissions of GSHPs, both for current and future scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this paper is to measure the ecological footprint (EF) of energy and electricity consumption by the residents of an Irish city-region, in terms of the land area required to sequester carbon emissions from energy and electricity consumption and to Support energy infrastructure and development. The EF was also used to analyse the impact of potential scenarios and policies and results were compared with the business as usual (BAU) projection in order to identify the optimal policy measure. It was found that the total EF for domestic energy and electricity consumption by Limerick residents increased by 7% from 0.125 global hectares (gha) per capita in 1996 to 0.134 gha per capita in 2002.
   The EF was then used to assess different policy measures or scenarios. It was concluded that Scenario 2, which proposes reducing energy and electricity consumption, was the most preferable option, and Scenario 4, which proposes increasing the contribution of short rotation coppice (SRC), the least preferable option. This suggests that absolute reduction and demand management should be prioritised over renewables substitution in a policy hierarchy. Of the renewable energy scenarios, Scenario 4 has the highest EF as a result of land appropriation for biomass production. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The scope for diffusion of very low-enthalpy geothermal plants in the Piemonte region of Italy, using groundwater heat pumps (GWHP), was analyzed to check environmental sustainability and the benefits in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. GWHP implementation seemed particularly suitable to the specific characteristics of the Piemonte plain. An important thick and productive shallow aquifer is present across the entire plain beneath the major energy users and is therefore appropriate for geothermal energy development purposes. The building stock could be adapted to heat pumps in different ways, but objective-oriented policies will be required to reach the best results in terms of environmental benefits.

TI TOWARDS CO2 NEUTRAL URBAN PLANNING: Presenting the Rotterdam
   Energy Approach and Planning (REAP)
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB By the year 2025 Rotterdam aims to have halved its CO2 emissions; an ambitious plan that will require a revolutionary approach to urban areas. One proactive response to this challenge is an exploratory study of the Hart van Zuid area. An interdisciplinary team has investigated how to tackle CO2-issues in a structured way. This has resulted in the Rotterdam Energy Approach and Planning (REAP) methodology. REAP supports initial demand for energy, propagates the use of waste streams and advocates use of renewable energy sources to satisfy the remaining demand. REAP can be applied at all levels: individual buildings, clusters of buildings and even whole neighhourhoods. Applying REAP to the Hart van Zuid has shown that this existing area can become CO2 neutral. Best of all: REAP can be applied everywhere.

   strategies for Seoul, South Korea: A sustainable urban systems framework
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Urban systems; Climate change; Energy; Land-cover greenhouse-gas
   reduction
AB Major cities have a significant impact on global and regional climate change due to their intensive material and energy use accompanied by population growth and the physical expansion of the metro region. This study presents the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework for assessing the causes and effects of climate change involved with the built environment at different scales with a case study of Seoul, South Korea. The Seoul metro region is the sixth most densely populated area in the world, and the region's rapid population growth has resulted in dramatic increases in both energy consumption and land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. South Korea is now the ninth largest Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emitter in the world and the third largest in Asia. Our results indicate that the system inputs and impacts of the proposed framework (urban population, LULC change, greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, and energy consumption) are closely related to the system pressures of energy security and GHG-reduction requirements. To meet the goal for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, Seoul must cut down its annual CO2 emissions by 3.4 million metric tons. The city's current intervention strategies will result in a reduction of only 2.1 million metric tons a year, a deficit of 1.3 million metric tons. Our preliminary results indicate that the Seoul government can strengthen its CO2 reduction strategy by incorporating built environment factors from the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework. By adopting energy-efficient-building standards, CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 1.34 million metric tons per year, suggesting a promising approach to lowering the city's energy use and GHG emissions.

AB Because of the needs of sustainable development of the mankind society and natural environment building a renewable energy system is one of the most critical issues that today's society must address. In the new energy system there is a requirement for a renewable fuel to replace current energy carrier. Hydrogen is an ideal secondary energy. Using solar energy to produce hydrogen in large scale can solve the problems of sustainability, environmental emissions, and energy security and become the focus of the international society in the area of energy science and technology. It has also been set as an important research direction by many international hydrogen programs. The Ministry of Science and Technology of China supported and launched a project of National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) - the Basic Research of Mass Hydrogen Production using Solar Energy in 2003 for R&D in the areas of solar hydrogen production. The current status of solar hydrogen production research is reviewed and some significant results achieved in the project are reported in this paper. The trends of development and the future research directions in the field of solar hydrogen production in China are also briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates thermal performance of an existing eco-friendly and low embodied energy vault roof passive house (or mud-house) located at Solar Energy Park of IIT Delhi, New Delhi (India). Based on embodied energy analysis, the energy payback time for the mud-house was determined as 18 years. The embodied energy per unit floor area of R.C.C. building (3702.3 MJ/m(2)) is quiet high as compared to the mud-house (2298.8 MJ/m(2)). The mud-house has three rooms with inverted U-shape roof and remaining three rooms with dome shape roof. A thermal model of the house consisting of six interconnected rooms was developed based on energy balance equations which were solved by using fourth order Runge Kutta numerical method. The predicted six room air temperatures were found in good agreement with the experimental observed data on hourly basis in each month for one year. The annual heating and cooling energy saving potential of the mud-house was determined as 1481 kW h/year and 1813 kW h/year respectively for New Delhi composite climate. The total mitigation of CO2 emissions due to both heating and cooling energy saving potential was determined as 5.2 metric tons/year. The annual carbon credit potential of mud-house was determined as (sic) 52/year. Similar results were obtained for the different climatic locations in India. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Our environment is an important resource, not only for use in development, but to conserve. In the 1990s, the importance of our environment became underscored for conservation efforts in many areas. Among them, the building construction industry had played a role in impoverishing the environment, for the sake of improving our quality of life, but at a great cost of impact to the environment. It is therefore incumbent upon the industry to endeavor to mitigate effects from building constructions to our environment.
   During the life cycle of a building, it consumes energy and other natural resources. But it is difficult to evaluate their effects on the environment during the entire course of a building's life span, without much time and effort. An easy to handle program is necessary for the calculation of effects to the environment during the life cycle of a building. Many of the software programs developed for these kinds of assessments can only be used with significant restrictions because of their differences in design for scope and content. This paper presents foundations for the development of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) program for buildings, focusing on their energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission levels, with a comparison of domestically and foreign designed programs.

AB The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has calculated and shown that, currently, the buildings sector has the largest potential for low-cost carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation in the short to medium term from application of technological options among the sectors examined, based on bottom-up studies. The potential estimates, however, were derived with no regard to indirect costs of CO2 mitigation, associated benefits, and non-technological options; these factors might change the magnitude of the potential and the costs associated with its implementation. The question emerges how accurate the indicators of the economic potential are according to the current IPCC method and how much they might change if all factors mentioned were taken into account. While research results are presently not sufficient to fully answer this question and quantitative analyses of non-technological options, transaction costs associated with barriers, and non-energy benefits are scarce and fragmented, this paper makes a first attempt to assess the presently available literature in the field. The paper concludes that the ballpark is right for the figures reporting the cost-effective potentials in the buildings sector; however, these assessments indeed need to be corrected by incurred transaction costs and co-benefits relevant for the particular assessment, as well as the potential of non-technological options. The paper also outlines a research agenda in the area so that a possible next Assessment Report of the IPCC can derive a more accurate estimate of the bottom-up potential of CO2 mitigation.

AB Background, aims, and scope In this study, we focused on the biomass di-methyl ether (Bio-DME) and the biomass methanol (Bio-MeOH) in BTL (Biomass to Liquid) fuels which might bring a solution on an energy storage and/or CO2 emissions abatement. For these fuels, our object is to estimate CO2 emissions and energy intensities (the specific energy consumption in each sub-process) for the biomass liquefaction system, which is expanded to material's transportation, energy conversion and fuel transportation in detail. Materials and methods In this paper, we estimated life cycle inventories (CO2 emissions and energy intensities) on Bio-DME and Bio-MeOH using the bottom-up methodology. The system boundary consists of the pre-processing, the biomass liquefaction process and the fuel transportation. In order to evaluate the uncertainties in the pre-processing, the moisture content of biomass materials and the transportation distance to the plant were considered by the Monte Carlo simulation. Also, in the energy conversion process, our system is built up by gasification through the BLUE Tower (BT) process, with the liquefaction process. In addition, in the fuel transportation, we assumed that the liquefied fuel (Bio-DME/Bio-MeOH) was delivered to the end-users at a distance of 209 km round trip.
   Results First, the assumptions for estimation of CO2 emissions and energy intensities in the pre-processing were as follows: The biomass materials are the waste products from Japanese Cedar. Also, the uncertainties of moisture content and transportation distance are assumed to be 20 to 50 wt.% and 5 to 50 km, respectively. In the case that the reaction temperature and the pressure in the liquefaction plant were 210-290 degrees C and 2.0-5.0 MPaA of DME/MeOH synthesis, the production rate of DME is 37,634 to 44,912 GJ/yr, and that of MeOH was 30,562 to 39,865 GJ/yr. These production rates are used as functional units of CO2 emissions and energy intensities. Under these operational conditions, CO2 emissions for the entire system are 42.3-64.6 g-CO2/MJ-Fuel of Bio-DME, and 48.3-77.7 g-CO2/MJ-Fuel of Bio-MeOH, respectively. Also, energy intensities are 1.22-1.65 MJ/MJ-Fuel of Bio-DME, and 1.42-2.03 MJ/MJ-Fuel of Bio-MeOH, respectively.
   Discussion The effects on the operation conditions of temperature and pressure were as follows: In general, in the liquefaction synthesis, a good result (the liquefied fuel at a higher efficiency) is obtained as the pressure would be increased. Also, the temperature to encourage the reaction well is required to some extent. The specific CO2 emissions would decrease as the temperature drops. Note that the minimum temperature of DME or MeOH synthesis is at least 210-220 degrees C. Meanwhile, CO2 emissions would decrease as the pressure increases. However, in the case of Bio-DME fuel, CO2 emissions would be slightly worse. This implies that the production rate is not ideal, compared to the total energy consumption. In all conditions we analyzed, Bio-DME/MeOH production indicated that energy intensities were lower than 2.0 MJ/MJ-Fuel, and that there was a potential to mitigate CO2 emissions.
   Conclusion We focused on a small gasification-liquefaction plant from the perspective of biomass resources distribution. Although this circumstance might be unique to Japan, the plant scale for the biomass energy use would not be able to expand. Nowadays, the fuel of biomass to liquid (BTL)is exceedingly being counted on as a promising fuel, so as to reduce CO2 emissions. However, when considering the collection area of biomass resources, the moisture content, the plant scale and the auxiliary power, it is implied that BioMeOH/DME does not always reduce CO2 emissions on an LCA basis, compared to a conventional plant.
   Recommendations and perspectives The LCA of the small scale biomass energy system we treated in our study is extremely significant to build a sustainable biomass energy system, since we presume that the utilization of biomass resources would compete with other strategies such as food production, etc. For future work, the feasibility studies on the wheel efficiency and/or the investigation of demand of DME/MeOH will be required from the perspectives of a diversity of energy sources, and/or alternative fuels use.

AB There is significant evidence that the world is warming. The International Panel of Climate Change stated that there would be a steady increase in the ambient temperature during the end of the 21st century. This increase will impact the built environment, particularly the requirements of energy used for airconditioning buildings. This paper discusses issues related to the potential impact of global warming on air-conditioning energy use in the hot climate of the United Arab Emirates. Al-Ain city was chosen for this study. Simulation studies and energy analysis were employed to investigate the energy consumption of buildings and the most effective measures to cope with this impact under different climate scenarios. The paper focuses on residential buildings and concludes that global warming is likely to increase the energy used for cooling buildings by 23.5% if Al-Ain city warms by 5.9 degrees C. The net CO2 emissions could increase at around 5.4% over the next few decades. The simulation results show that the energy design measures such as thermal insulation and thermal mass are important to cope with global warming, while window area and glazing system are beneficial and sensitive to climate change, whereas the shading devices are moderate as a building CO2 emissions saver and insensitive to global warming.

ID UK HOUSING STOCK
AB The Community Domestic Energy Model (CDEM) has been developed to explore potential routes to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the model is used to predict the CO2 emissions of the existing English housing stock. The average dwelling CO2 emissions are estimated as 5827 kgCO(2) per year, of which space heating accounts for 53%, water heating for 20%, cooking for 5%, and lights and appliance for 22%. Local sensitivity analysis is undertaken for dwellings of different age and type to investigate the effect on predicted emissions of uncertainty in the model's inputs. High normalized sensitivity coefficients were calculated for parameters that affect the space heating energy use. The effects of the input uncertainties were linear and superposable, so the impact of multiple uncertainties could be easily determined. The results show that the accumulated impact on national CO2 emissions of the underperformance of energy-efficiency measures could be very large. Quality control of the complete energy system in new and refurbished dwellings is essential if national CO2 targets are to be met. Quality control needs to prioritize detached dwellings because their emissions are both the greatest and the most sensitive to all energy-efficiency measures. The work demonstrates that the uncertainty in the predictions of stock models can be large; a failure to acknowledge this can lead to a false sense of their reliability.

AB The UK government has ambitious goals to reduce national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and has targeted the new and existing built stock with measures to improve building performance and provide more local and centralized renewable energy. New dwellings are proposed to be 'net-zero carbon' by 2016, which includes proposals to offset CO2 by integrating new and existing development. To what extent can new zero-carbon communities be more readily achieved through increasing the integration between new and existing domestic developments? A methodology is presented for determining the ratio of on-site renewable energy supply to energy demand for a series of densities using a simplified model. Options that increase the proportion of existing dwellings served by a new development to balance further energy demands are presented. The practical opportunities and constraints are considered for integrating new and existing domestic development to achieve net-zero carbon. Meeting net-zero on-site annual energy requirements through on-site energy resources is possible even at high urban densities, with annual average supply/demand ratios of approximately 2.3. Also, integrating existing dwellings may offer an opportunity to improve supply/demand ratios for further CO2 reductions; low densities are shown to have annual supply/demand ratios of approximately 9.5. Although a finer temporal scale illustrates the limitations of an annual average and the variable nature of on-site energy resources; this straightforward method can act as a catalyst in achieving net-zero-carbon communities. Le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni s'est fixe des objectifs ambitieux de reduction des emissions de dioxyde de carbone (CO2) au niveau national et a decide de viser le parc bati existant et les constructions neuves par des mesures destinees a ameliorer les performances des batiments et a fournir davantage d'energies renouvelables locales et centralisees. Il est propose que les nouveaux logements soient << zero carbone net >> d'ici a 2016, ceci incluant des propositions pour compenser le CO2 par l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux. Dans quelle mesure peut-on parvenir plus facilement a de nouvelles communautes zero carbone en augmentant l'integration entre les ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux? Il est presente une methodologie permettant de determiner le rapport entre l'offre en energies renouvelables locales et la demande en energie pour une serie de densites d'habitation en utilisant un modele simplifie. Sont presentes des choix qui augmentent la part des logements existants desservis par un nouvel ensemble de logements afin d'equilibrer les demandes d'energie supplementaires. Les possibilites et les contraintes pratiques relatives a l'integration des ensembles de logements existants et nouveaux pour atteindre le << zero carbone net >> sont examinees. Il est possible de repondre a des besoins energetiques annuels locaux << zero carbone net >> par des ressources energetiques locales, meme avec des densites urbaines elevees, pour des rapports annuels moyens offre/demande d'environ 2.3. De plus, le fait d'integrer les logements existants peut donner la possibilite d'ameliorer les rapports offre/demande afin de reduire encore les emissions de CO2; il est montre que des densites d'habitation faibles presentent des rapports annuels offre/demande d'environ 9.5.
   Bien qu'une echelle de temps plus fine illustre les limites d'une moyenne annuelle et la nature variable des ressources energetiques ocales, cette methode simple peut faire office de catalyseur pour realiser des communautes << zero carbone net >>. Mots cles: energie domestique, strategie energetique, planification de quartier, energies renouvelables locales, modele de l'offre et de la demande, zero carbone.

AB The increase Of CO2 emissions and the emerging climate change are the most serious environmental problems nowadays and limit economic development. This increase is mainly attributed to the growing world population and the related growth in energy demand, which results in the vast consumption of fossil fuels in the power generation sector. Significant actions for the implementation of energy saving measures have been adopted worldwide for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 calculators have been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures, relating energy to CO2 emissions. These calculators include in most cases the entire power system. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the role of the electricity. networks' losses in the actual CO2 reduction potential, following the implementation of energy saving measures, in relation to the network's voltage level in which the infrastructure is connected. Buildings are representative due to their volume and to different voltage levels of power supply. The work presented was conducted in the framework of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme entitled Bottom Up to Kyoto (BUtK), as a part of an evaluation of the CO2 emissions' reduction potential through energy savings measures in 6 municipalities of EU's New Member States.

   architecture; green buildings; energy modeling
AB The first step to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings is to be able to count them. If this counting is integrated in the design process the impact of architectural design strategies can be evaluated more easily and a building with reduced emissions can be developed. Fifty greenhouse gas calculators and energy modeling software were compared in the main areas in which buildings are responsible for carbon emissions: operation, water, construction, waste and transportation to and from the building. These tools had to be free and easy to use so that they could be used by everybody in the initial phases of the architectural design process, while providing sufficient precision to provide useful input to the designer. The effect of modifying the envelope insulation, the quality of the windows, the efficiency of the heating and cooling systems, and integrating direct gain and night ventilation, on operation emissions was evaluated with two energy modeling tools: HEED and Design Builder. Results demonstrated that implementing appropriate design strategies significantly reduced emissions from operation in all climates. An easy to implement protocol that combines several tools for GHG counting in buildings is provided at the end.

AB This article presents a simulation model for application to several commercial sector buildings in a particular area to analyse the impact of changes in buildings and building energy systems on the issue domains of mitigation of global warming and heat island phenomena as well as the planning of urban infrastructures for electricity and water. The impact on these issue domains is evaluated using five indicators: primary energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission, sensible anthropogenic heat release, peak electricity demand and water consumption by cooling towers. This article explains the modelling methodology, the simulation model including databases and a case study carried out to demonstrate the simulation capacity of the model. The case study shows that the form and function of buildings influence energy consumption and the five indicators significantly. The trade-off relationship is also shown between the five indicators with respect to changes in the heat-source system of buildings.

AB Problem: In the absence of U.S. federal action to address the problem of climate change, a diverse array of nonfederal policy entrepreneurs and climate action planners has produced an impressive body of plans and policies to fight climate change at the regional, state, and local levels. Their actions are highly laudable, but have they actually reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions? Purpose: This article evaluates the work of a group of innovative state-level policy entre-preneurs whose actions were chronicled by Barry Rabe, and a set of 29 state climate action plans systematically analyzed by Stephen Wheeler. It compares states with and without climate policy entrepreneurs and states with and without climate action plans, asks if either plans or entrepreneurs have been successful in reducing CO2 emissions, and identifies the elements within plans that are associated with the greatest reductions. Methods: The analysis uses multiple regression models to explain changes in per capita CO2 emissions attributable to residen-tial, commercial, transportation, and total nonindustrial end users from 1990 to 2007. A package of control variables accounts for political, social, climatic, economic, and urban form factors, while policy variables isolate the effects of climate policy entrepre-neurs, climate action planners, and specific policy recommendations within climate action plans. Results and conclusions: State-level climate actions reduce GHG emissions by a measurable but modest amount: about one half metric ton per person per year. This represents 2-3% of the average American's 24-ton annual total GHG emissions. The reduction is small in comparison to the magnitude of the problem, but a substantial tax increase or population shift away from sprawling areas would be necessary to achieve the same reduction. specific policies I find to be associated with lower emissions include: building efficiency in both residential and commercial sectors, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) policies in the commercial sector, and California's vehicle efficiency standards in the transportation sector. Takeaway for practice: It is encouraging that we can already identify emission reduc-tions related to state climate action. However, the observed reductions remain small com-pared to the scope of the problem. These findings should persuade states without plans to begin the planning process while encourag-ing states with plans to encourage more entrepreneurship aimed at developing a second generation of policy options for stabilizing our planet's climate with or without federal action. Research support: None.

ID GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY; RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB In the current study the savings of CO2 emissions due to the use of ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems was investigated in comparison to conventional heating systems. Based on a subsidy program for GSHP systems in southwest Germany, the regional, average, and total CO2 savings of 1105 installed GSHP systems were determined on a regional scale. The emitted CO2 per kWh of heating demand for the studied scenario resulted in 149 g CO2/kWh for GSHP using the German electricity mix and 65 g CO2/kWh using the regional electricity mix, which results in CO2 savings of 35% or 72%, respectively. Similar CO2 avoidances of GSHP systems were found in American and European studies ranging between 15% and 77% strongly depending on the supplied energy for the heat pumps and the efficiency of installation. The resulting CO2 savings for one installed GSHP unit in the present study therefore range between 1800 and 4000 kg per year. Nevertheless, the minimum average total annual CO2 savings of all installed GSHP systems due to the subsidy program amounted to 2000 tons per year. The maximum regional avoided additional CO2 emissions are primarily associated with the affluent suburbs of the most densely populated area in the region. In 2006 the total contribution of CO2 savings due to GSHP systems in Germany was only about 3.4% of the total renewable energies. However, continuously rising numbers of installed GSHP units and the increasing use of renewable electricity demonstrate that there is a fine opportunity to substantially avoid additional CO2 emissions associated with the provision of heating (and cooling) of buildings and other facilities.

AB Reactive building materials offer an opportunity to provide indoor air cleaning with minimal energy use. Laboratory and test house experiments provide evidence that indoor ozone concentrations can be diminished by activated carbon (AC) and unpainted gypsum wallboard (GWB) panels. These two materials are highly reactive with ozone and produce few byproducts. When measured in a 14.2 m(3) stainless-steel chamber, the mean deposition velocities to the materials were 5.3 m h(-1) for AC and 2.4 m h(-1) for GWB for a variety of airflow and relative humidity conditions. The ozone decay rates for both the materials were also measured in an unoccupied 34.5 m(3) bedroom under various mixing conditions. In this case, ozone removal increased relative to background by 27-100% with a 4.4 m(2) panel of a reactive material placed on one wall of the bedroom. The ozone decay rate for the bedroom increased over background by approximately 2-3 h(-1) for GWB and 2-7 h(-1) for AC. Application of a mass balance model for a typical home demonstrates that effectiveness for ozone removal depends weakly on the air exchange rate and strongly on the panel material, panel area, and mixing conditions. An ozone removal effectiveness of over 80% is possible with sufficient panel area and positioning that provides elevated air speeds near the panels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Climate change and future energy consumption in UK housing stock
SO BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the likely effects on gas and electricity consumption and carbon emissions from heating and cooling systems in existing dwellings up to 2080, assuming a widespread uptake of cooling systems. This area of research is highly sensitive to the myriad of possible inputs and thus holds a wide range of predicted outcomes. However, general trends have been found, showing significant sensitivity to ventilation rate, U-values, occupant behaviour and location. Heating demand will still be dominant over cooling demand in UK dwellings by the 2080s, based on an UKCIP02 A1F1 weather scenario. A national worst case scenario for the 2050s, shows a 10 megatonne CO2 emissions saving on present levels largely due to a 20% reduction in gas consumption.
   Practical applications: The balance of heating and cooling demand causes more modest changes in CO2 than first anticipated. Despite first perceptions of future energy use in housing and climate change, heating appears to remain the major load rather than cooling, even into the 2080s. These predictions of future CO2 emissions will be useful to those in the building industry planning appropriate proportionate climate adaptation and climate mitigation measures. Also, the prediction of changes to future energy demands from the housing sector will be of interest to energy providers considering future demands for heating and cooling and may feed into larger bottom-up energy models.

AB The space heating demand of residential buildings can be decreased by improved insulation, reduced air leakage and by heat recovery from ventilation air. However, these measures result in an increased use of materials. As the energy for building operation decreases, the relative importance of the energy used in the production phase increases and influences optimization aimed at minimizing the life cycle energy use. The life cycle primary energy use of buildings also depends on the energy supply systems. In this work we analyse primary energy use and CO2 emission for the production and operation of conventional and low-energy residential buildings. Different types of energy supply systems are included in the analysis. We show that for a conventional and a low-energy building the primary energy use for production can be up to 45% and 60%, respectively, of the total. depending on the energy supply system, and with larger variations for conventional buildings. The primary energy used and the CO2 emission resulting from production are lower for wood-framed constructions than for concrete-framed constructions. The primary energy use and the CO2 emission depend strongly on the energy supply, for both conventional and low-energy buildings. For example, a single-family house from the 1970s heated with biomass-based district heating with cogeneration has 70% lower operational primary energy use than if heated with fuel-based electricity. The specific primary energy use with district heating was 40% lower than that of an electrically heated passive row house. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study the life cycle primary energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of an eight-storey wood-framed apartment building are analyzed. All life cycle phases are included, including acquisition and processing of materials, on-site construction, building operation, demolition and materials disposal. The calculated primary energy use includes the entire energy system chains, and carbon flows are tracked including fossil fuel emissions, process emissions, carbon stocks in building materials, and avoided fossil emissions due to biofuel substitution. The results show that building operation uses the largest share of life cycle energy use, becoming increasingly dominant as the life span of the building increases. The type of heating system strongly influences the primary energy use and CO2 emission; a biomass-based system with cogeneration of district heat and electricity achieves low primary energy use and very low CO2 emissions. Using biomass residues from the wood products chain to substitute for fossil fuels significantly reduces net CO2 emission. Excluding household tap water and electricity, a negative life cycle net CO2 emission can be achieved due to the wood-based construction materials and biomass-based energy supply system. This study shows the importance of using a life cycle perspective when evaluating primary energy and climatic impacts of buildings. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heating. ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) are parts of the major energy consumption in a building. Conventional heating and cooling systems are having an impact on carbon dioxide emissions. as well as on security of energy supply. In this regard, one of the attempts taken by researchers is the development of solar heating and cooling technologies. The objective of this paper is to review the passive solar technologies for space heating and cooling. The reviews were discussed according to the working mechanisms. i.e. buoyancy and evaporative effects. The advantages, limitations and challenges of the technologies have been highlighted and the future research needs in these areas have also been suggested. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the case of Denmark, this paper analyses the role of district heating in future Renewable Energy Systems. At present, the share of renewable energy is coming close to 20 per cent. From such point of departure, the paper defines a scenario framework in which the Danish system is converted to 100 per cent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the year 2060 including reductions in space heating demands by 75 per cent. By use of a detailed energy system analysis of the complete national energy system, the consequences in relation to fuel demand, CO2 emissions and cost are calculated for various heating options, including district heating as well as individual heat pumps and micro CHPs (Combined Heat and Power). The study includes almost 25 per cent of the Danish building stock, namely those buildings which have individual gas or oil boilers today and could be substituted by district heating or a more efficient individual heat source. In such overall perspective, the best solution will be to combine a gradual expansion of district heating with individual heat pumps in the remaining houses. Such conclusion is valid in the present systems, which are mainly based on fossil fuels, as well as in a potential future system based 100 per cent on renewable energy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cool roofs-roofs that stay cool in the sun by minimizing solar absorption and maximizing thermal emission-lessen the flow of heat from the roof into the building, reducing the need for space cooling energy in conditioned buildings. Cool roofs may also increase the need for heating energy in cold climates. For a commercial building, the decrease in annual cooling load is typically much greater than the increase in annual heating load. This study combines building energy simulations, local energy prices, local electricity emission factors, and local estimates of building density to characterize local, state average, and national average cooling energy savings, heating energy penalties, energy cost savings, and emission reductions per unit conditioned roof area. The annual heating and cooling energy uses of four commercial building prototypes-new office (1980+), old office (pre-1980), new retail (1980+), and old retail (pre-1980)-were simulated in 236 US cities. Substituting a weathered cool white roof (solar reflectance 0.55) for a weathered conventional gray roof (solar reflectance 0.20) yielded annually a cooling energy saving per unit conditioned roof area ranging from 3.30 kWh/m(2) in Alaska to 7.69 kWh/m(2) in Arizona (5.02 kWh/m(2) nationwide); a heating energy penalty ranging from 0.003 therm/m(2) in Hawaii to 0.14 therm/m(2) in Wyoming (0.065 therm/m(2) nationwide); and an energy cost saving ranging from $0.126/m(2) in West Virginia to $1.14/m(2) in Arizona ($0.356/m(2) nationwide). It also offered annually a CO(2) reduction ranging from 1.07 kg/m(2) in Alaska to 4.97 kg/m(2) in Hawaii (3.02 kg/m(2) nationwide); an NO(x) reduction ranging from 1.70 g/m(2) in New York to 11.7 g/m(2) in Hawaii (4.81 g/m(2) nationwide); an SO(2) reduction ranging from 1.79 g/m(2) in California to 26.1 g/m(2) in Alabama (12.4 g/m(2) nationwide); and an Hg reduction ranging from 1.08 mu g/m(2) in Alaska to 105 mu g/m(2) in Alabama (61.2 mu g/m(2) nationwide). Retrofitting 80% of the 2.58 billion square meters of commercial building conditioned roof area in the USA would yield an annual cooling energy saving of 10.4 TWh; an annual heating energy penalty of 133 million therms; and an annual energy cost saving of $735 million. It would also offer an annual CO(2) reduction of 6.23 Mt, offsetting the annual CO(2) emissions of 1.20 million typical cars or 25.4 typical peak power plants; an annual NO(x) reduction of 9.93 kt, offsetting the annual NO(x) emissions of 0.57 million cars or 65.7 peak power plants; an annual SO(2) reduction of 25.6 kt, offsetting the annual SO(2) emissions of 815 peak power plants; and an annual Hg reduction of 126 kg.

DE Residential carbon savings; Energy Performance Certificate; Subsidy
AB Since more than two-thirds of the United Kingdom housing stock in 2050 will comprise houses that have already been built, the need for a focus of policy on the already-built private housing stock is apparent. This study examines the impact that subsidy can make in bolstering the performance of the Energy Performance Certificate by reducing carbon emissions in the residential sector. The results of a survey of new homeowners' uptake of nine commonly installed energy saving measures in response to subsidy are examined. A cost-benefit analysis is performed using the recently introduced concept of the Shadow Price of Carbon and a model is presented which allows the carbon savings for any level of subsidy to be calculated. The model suggests that subsidisation of the installation of hot water tank insulation, draught proofing measures, loft insulation and cavity wall insulation may be cost-effective, but that the subsidisation of others, most notably interior solid wall insulation, are unlikely to significantly bolster carbon savings.

AB P>This article evaluates the implications of uncertainty in the life cycle (LC) energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of rapeseed oil (RO) as an energy carrier displacing fossil diesel (FD). Uncertainties addressed include parameter uncertainty as well as scenario uncertainty concerning how RO coproduct credits are accounted for (uncertainty due to modeling choices). We have carried out an extensive data collection to build an LC inventory accounting for parameter uncertainty. Different approaches for carbon stock changes associated with converting set-aside land to rapeseed cultivation have been considered, which result in different values: from -0.25 t C/ha.yr (carbon uptake by the soil in tonnes per hectare year) to 0.60 t C/ha.yr (carbon emission). Energy renewability efficiency and GHG emissions of RO are presented, which show the influence of parameter versus scenario uncertainty. Primary energy savings and avoided GHG emissions when RO displaces FD have also been calculated: Avoided GHG emissions show considerably higher uncertainty than energy savings, mainly due to land use (nitrous oxide emissions from soil) and land use conversion (carbon stock changes). Results demonstrate the relevance of applying uncertainty approaches; emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the environmental life cycle modeling, particularly GHG emissions calculation; and show the importance of integrating uncertainty into the interpretation of results.

AB The design and operation of combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems are greatly dependent upon the seasonal atmospheric conditions, which determine thermal and power demands of buildings. This paper presents a mathematical analysis of CCHP system in comparison to separate system. The corresponding primary energy consumption in thermal demand management (TDM) and electrical demand management (EDM) operation modes are deduced. Three relative criteria, primary energy saving (PES), CO2 emission reduction (CO2ER), and annual total cost saving (ATCS) are employed to evaluate the respective performances of CCHP systems for a hypothetical building in five different climate zones from the technical, environmental and economic aspects. The results indicate that CCHP system in TDM mode in the cold area, where the building requires more heating during the year, achieves more benefit over separate system while CCHP system in EDM mode suits the building having stable thermal demand in mild climate zone.

AB In recent times, studies on the management and maintenance of facilities have increased in Japan. However, these studies focus only on residential buildings and private offices. As far as public facilities are concerned, the government is focused only on surveying the amount of stock and on the basic notion of maintenance. There is a lack of government initiatives for the maintenance of public facilities. Only regular maintenance can help in increasing the efficiency and life cycle of these facilities. Further, to solve the current problems such as energy crisis, CO2 emissions and decreasing of tax revenue caused by an aging society, it is necessary to prolong the life cycle of public facilities and efficiently maintain them.
   This study examines the present state of management and maintenance of public facilities mainly focusing on the present conditions of municipalities receiving low financial support and compares the maintenance facilities of these municipalities. For this purpose, radar charts and the PPM matrix were used. It is found that even in badly supported districts, energy consumption and the number of facility users are high. Further, some municipalities are found to be efficiently managing the public facilities, and their management and maintenance skills are worth benchmarking.

ID CHP
AB Replacing individual natural gas heating with district heating based to increasing shares of renewable energy sources may further reduce CO2-emissions in the Danish Building mass, while increasing flexibility of the energy system to accommodate significantly larger amounts of variable renewable energy production. The present paper describes a geographical study of the potential to expand district heating into areas supplied with natural gas. The study uses a highly detailed spatial database of the built environment, its current and potential future energy demand, its supply technologies and its location relative to energy infrastructure. First, using a spatially explicit economic model, the study calculates the potentials and costs of connection to expanded district heating networks by supply technology. Then a comprehensive energy systems analysis is carried out to model how the new district heat can be supplied from an energy system with higher shares of renewable energy. It can be concluded on the basis of these analyses that the methods used proved highly useful to address issues of geographically dependent energy supply; however the spatio-economic model still is rather crude. The analyses suggest to expand district heating from present 46% to somewhere in between 50% and 70%. The most attractive potential is located around towns and cities. The study also suggests that CO2-emissions, fuel consumption and socioeconomic costs can be reduced by expanding district heating, while at the same time investing in energy savings in the building mass as well as increased district heating network efficiency.

AB A model is developed that simulates nationwide energy consumption of the residential sector by considering the diversity of household and building types. Since this model can simulate the energy consumption for each household and building category by dynamic energy use based on the schedule of the occupants' activities and a heating and cooling load calculation model, various kinds of energy-saving policies can be evaluated with considerable accuracy. In addition, the average energy efficiency of major electric appliances used in the residential sector and the percentages of housing insulation levels of existing houses is predicted by the "stock transition model." In this paper, energy consumption and CO(2) emissions in the Japanese residential sector until 2025 are predicted. For example, as a business - as-usual (BAU) case, CO(2) emissions will be reduced by 7% from the 1990 level. Also evaluated are mitigation measures such as the energy efficiency standard for home electric appliances, thermal insulation code, reduction of standby power, high-efficiency water heaters, energy-efficient behavior of occupants, and dissemination of photovoltaic panels.

AB The feasibility of halving greenhouse gas emissions from hotels by 2030 has been studied as part of the Carbon Vision Buildings Programme. The aim of that programme was to study ways of reducing emissions from the existing stock because it will be responsible for the majority of building emissions over the next few decades. The work was carried out using detailed computer simulation using the ESP-r tool. Two hotels were studied, one older and converted and the other newer and purpose-built, with the aim of representing the most common UK hotel types.
   The effects were studied of interventions expected to be available in 2030 including fabric improvements, HVAC changes, lighting and appliance improvements and renewable energy generation. The main finding was that it is technically feasible to reduce emissions by 50% without compromising guest comfort. Ranking of the interventions was problematical for several reasons including interdependence and the impacts on boiler sizing of large reductions in the heating load. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated the potential impact of climate change on the heating and cooling (H/C) energy requirements of residential houses in five regional climates varying from cold to hot humid in Australia. Nine General Circulation Models (GCMs) under three carbon emission scenarios were applied to project the local climate. It was found that significant climate change impact on H/C energy requirements may occur within the lifespan of existing housing stock. The total H/C energy requirement of newly constructed 5 star houses is projected to vary significantly in the range of -26% to 101% by 2050 and -48% to 350% by 2100 given the A1B, A1FI and 550 ppm stabilisation emission scenarios, dependent on the existing regional climate. In terms of percentage change, houses in an H/C balanced temperate climate such as Sydney is found to be the most sensitive to climate change, potentially posing more pressures on the capacity of local energy supply. It was also found that energy efficient or high star rating houses may experience less absolute changes in energy requirement. However, they appear to experience higher percentage changes in the total H/C energy requirement. Especially in the regions with an H/C balanced temperate climate such as Sydney, the increase in the total H/C energy requirement is projected up to 120% and 530% for a 7 star house when the global temperature increases 2 degrees C and 5 degrees C respectively. The high sensitivity to global warming may need to be considered in the planning of future energy requirement for energy efficient buildings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When the service life (or primary life) of built concrete infrastructure has elapsed, a common practice is that the demolished concrete is crushed and recycled, then incorporated into new construction. LCA studies of CO(2) emissions focus on the manufacturing and construction and occupancy/utilization phases, without consideration of the demolition and application of recycled concrete into a secondary construction application. Concrete has a documented ability to chemically react with airborne carbon dioxide (CO(2)); however, carbon capture (or carbonation) by concrete during the primary and secondary life, is not considered in LCA models. This paper incorporates CO(2) capture during both primary and secondary life into an LCA model for built concrete.
   CO(2) equivalent (CO(2)-e) emissions were estimated by calculation of the quantity of CO(2)-e emitted per unit of activity at the point of emission release (i.e., fuel use, energy use, manufacturing activity, construction activity, on-site demolition, etc.). Carbonation was estimated for built concrete during the primary life and also during the secondary life when the demolished concrete structure is crushed and recycled for a new application within a new built structure. Life cycle calculations for a built bridge structure are provided which contrasts the net effects of CO(2) emission and capture. The study has analyzed a concrete bridge with primary life of 100 years. Following completion of the primary life, we have considered that the demolished concrete from the bridge will be crushed, recycled, and used in the construction of a replacement bridge. Due to damage caused by demolition and crushing, the quality of the recycled concrete is unlikely to be as high as quarried natural rock, and the recycled concrete is most likely to be used in a more temporary construction application with an assumed 30-year secondary life. Following the expiry of the secondary life, if recycling of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) was to be undertaken, it is unlikely the quality of RCA will be suitable to enable a third construction application: therefore, our LCA includes the primary life of 100 years plus the secondary life of 30 years.
   Carbonation of the built concrete during the primary life is almost negligible compared with the emissions arising from manufacture of raw materials, concrete production, and construction. However, CO(2) capture by recycled concrete during the secondary life is considerably greater: a factor that is not included in LCA estimates of the carbon footprint of built concrete. Crushed concrete has considerably greater exposed surface area, relative to volume, than a built concrete structure: therefore, a greater surface area of RCA, compared with a built structure, is exposed to CO(2) and carbonates. This key factor leads to such high amounts of carbonation during the secondary life when compared with the built structure.
   While reducing the amount of solid landfill, recycled concrete provides significant capture of airborne carbon dioxide. The effects of carbon capture of recycled concrete aggregate within the secondary life is significant, imbibing up to 41% of the CO(2) emitted during manufacture of a 100% Portland cement binder. Emission estimates can be overestimated by as much as 13-48%, depending on the type of cementitious binder in the built concrete and the application of recycled concrete during the secondary life. The effects of carbon capture of recycled concrete aggregate within the secondary life are significant and should be included in LCA calculations for reinforced concrete structures.
   Carbonation during the secondary life can be affected by the type of application and exposure of the RCA: gravel with fine particle size will carbonate more comprehensively than larger boulders (due to greater exposed surface area), while air-exposed RCA will carbonate more comprehensively than RCA located in a buried and moist environment. An approach is provided in this paper that incorporates carbon capture by concrete infrastructure into LCA carbon emission calculations. If carbonation is ignored, emission estimates can be overestimated by 13-48%, depending on the type of cement binder and the application of RCA during the secondary life.
   Due to the considerable number and types of built concrete structures, it is recommended that the LCA model be improved by incorporation of carbonation data obtained from recycled concretes that have been applied to a variety of construction applications and exposed to a range of exposure environments.

AB A low-energy family house recently built in Northern Italy was selected by Regione Piemonte as an outstanding example of resource efficient building. An economic incentive was awarded to cover the extra costs of the thermal insulation, windows and equipment in order to decrease the yearly winter heat requirement from the legal standard of 109 to 10 kW h/m(2), while existing buildings in the study area typically require 200 kW h/m(2). As the building was claimed to be sustainable on the basis of its outstanding energy-saving performance, an ex post life cycle assessment (LCA) was set up to understand whether, and to what extent, the positive judgement could be confirmed in a life cycle perspective.
   After an analysis of the literature on LCA of whole buildings, a detailed life cycle assessment has been conducted by encompassing all the life cycle phases. Emphasis was given on the end-of-life stage, too often disregarded due to lack of data or heavily simplified. Virtually all the materials used in the building structure, finishes and equipment were considered, paying attention to their expected service duration and the recycling potential. In order to increase transparency and therefore credibility and acceptance of LCA in the building sector, an uncertainty analysis was carried out.
   The dramatic contribution of material-related impacts emerged. Structure and finishes materials represented the highest relative contribution, but maintenance operations also played a major role. The contributions of equipment, construction stage and transportation were minor. The important role of the recycling potential also emerged. Unlike standard buildings, where heating-related impacts overshadow the rest of the life cycle, there is no single dominating item or aspect. Rather, several of them play equally important roles.
   The study confirmed that the initial goal of resource and environmental efficiency was reached, but to a much lower extent than previously thought. In comparison to a standard house, while the winter heat requirement was reduced from 109 to 10 kW h/m(2) (10:1 ratio), the life cycle energy was only reduced by 2.1:1 and the carbon footprint by 2.2:1.
   The findings emphasise the need for incorporating the life cycle approach in energy-saving policies and economic incentives schemes in the building sector, in Italy and elsewhere, as single-step improvements might not be effective in a life cycle perspective and could even disappoint expectations.

AB The timber sector, i.e., forestry and timber industry, plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of Ghana through timber products export. Timber production in this sector is associated with increasing environmental burdens in terms of use of materials and energy, production of emissions and waste, and land use changes. The purpose of this study was to compile a comprehensive life cycle inventory (LCI) to identify the most dominant environmental pressures for five major production lines in the timber industry, and to evaluate the influence of the choice of the functional unit on the results (1 m(3), 1 kg, and 1 euro). LCA's of wood typically base their functional unit on volume, but mass or money may be more appropriate for the rather different products considered in this study.
   The LCI covers five timber production lines, namely, air-dried lumber, kiln-dried lumber, plywood, veneer, and furniture parts. Three functional units were used for this study to identify the most appropriate basis for a fair comparison of the different timber products (functional units were 1 m(3), 1 kg and 1 euro). Questionnaires were administered to thirty selected companies in Ghana. These companies provided data about their material uses, energy requirements, and waste production for their operations from 2000 to 2007. The collected data were first converted into total annual average values, and next extrapolated to reflect the national average data for all 104 active companies. Finally, these data were expressed per functional unit for each of the five product lines on the basis of their production outputs (in volume, mass or money according to functional unit applied). Forest land used changes data was taken from the Ghana Timber Industry Development Division. Emissions for the several activities were taken from literature.
   Land use change for timber production in Ghana between the estimated periods turned out to be 34.0 x 10(3) ha per year, which will lead to complete deforestation in the year 2023 if continued. The total energy consumed by the timber sector per year was estimated at 1.9 x 10(9) MJ per year. The results showed that CO2 emissions by the timber sector activities per year accounted for 745k tons per year and dominate overall greenhouse gases emissions in the timber sector (changes in carbons storage related to land use changes not included). Wood waste by the timber sector accounted for 0.8 million m(3) per year. The enormous wastage of wood contributes enormously to the rapid depletion of the country's timber resources. The choice of the functional unit influences inventory results. The money-based functional unit, which also seems more appropriate for the different products considered, favors the value-added. Value-added products with strict sustainable forest management policy hold a promising future in terms of sustainability for the timber industry in Ghana.
   This study has yielded good quality primary data unique for LCA research in Africa. This will enhance LCA approaches in Ghana, and allows here identification of the main environmental pressures and their dominantly contributing processes in the timber sector. Land use changes due to forestry form a critical issue and require urgent attention. The chosen functional units' plays a crucial role in the environmental comparison of production line in the timber sector in Ghana.
   A comprehensive and transparent inventory for the timber industry provides the industry with an overview of areas in which material and thus economic savings can be made for the good of both environment and the industry finances. Good data keeping in the Ghanaian timber industry will help to build the required research capacity to develop local familiarity and competence in LCA techniques and applying these techniques will help to further certify tropical timber international markets.

AB There is a large potential to reduce primary energy use and CO2 emissions from the Swedish building stock. Here detached houses heated by oil, natural gas or electric boilers were assessed. CO2 emissions, primary energy use and heating costs were evaluated before and after implementing house envelope measures, conversions to more efficient heating systems and changes to biomass fuel use. The study included full energy chains, from natural resources to usable heat in the houses. The aim was to evaluate the societal economic cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emission and primary energy use by different combinations of changes. The results demonstrated that for a house using an electric boiler, a conversion to a heat pump combined with house envelope measures could be cost efficient from a societal economic perspective. If the electricity was based on biomass, the primary energy use was at the same time reduced by 70% and the CO2 emission by 97%. Large emission reductions were also seen for conversions from oil and gas boilers to a biomass-based system. However, for these conversions the heating cost increased, leading to a mitigation cost of around (sic)50/tonne C avoided. The price of oil and natural gas greatly influenced the competitiveness of the alternatives. House envelope measures were more cost-effective for houses with electric boilers as the cost of energy for this system is high. The results are specific to a Swedish context, but also give an indication of the potential in other regions, such as northern European and large parts of North America, which have both a cold climate and a widespread use of domestic boilers.

AB Local policy makers could benefit from a national, high-resolution inventory of energy consumption and related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions based on the Vulcan data product, which plots emissions on a 100 km(2) grid. We evaluate the ability of Vulcan to measure energy consumption in urban areas, a scale of analysis required to support goals established as part of local energy, climate or sustainability initiatives. We highlight the methodological challenges of this type of analytical exercise and review alternative approaches. We find that between 37% and 86% of direct fuel consumption in buildings and industry and between 37% and 77% of on-road gasoline and diesel consumption occurs in urban areas, depending on how these areas are defined. We suggest that a county-based definition of urban is preferable to other common definitions since counties are the smallest political unit for which energy data are collected. Urban counties, account for 37% of direct energy consumption, or 50% if mixed urban counties are included. A county-based definition can also improve estimates of per-capita consumption.

DE Carbon footprint; Metropolitan areas; Climate change
ID EMISSIONS; HOUSEHOLD; MEGACITIES; IMPACT; FORM
AB A dearth of available data on carbon emissions and comparative analysis between metropolitan areas make it difficult to confirm or refute best practices and policies. To help provide benchmarks and expand our understanding of urban centers and climate change, this article offers a preliminary comparison of the carbon footprints of 12 metropolitan areas. It does this by examining emissions related to vehicles, energy used in buildings, industry, agriculture, and waste. The carbon emissions from these sources-discussed here as the metro area's partial carbon footprint-provide a foundation for identifying the pricing, land use, help metropolitan areas throughout the world respond to climate change. The article begins by exploring a sample of the existing literature on urban morphology and climate change and explaining the methodology used to calculate each area's carbon footprint. The article then depicts the specific carbon footprints for Beijing, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Manila, Mexico City, New Delhi, New York, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Singapore, and Tokyo and compares these to respective national averages. It concludes by offering suggestions for how city planners and policymakers can reduce the carbon footprint of these and possibly other large urban areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Retrofitting sustainability to historic city core areas
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER
LA English
DT Article
DE conservation; energy conservation; sustainability
AB Historic, mixed-use, core urban areas such as Soho in Central London have proved remarkably resilient with building stock that is adaptable to changes of use over time. Such districts contribute significantly to the social fabric and cultural character of cities and are highly valued by their resident and user populations. In the UK, buildings, according to various estimates, contribute between 44 and 52% of the total carbon emissions and there is now considerable pressure to retrofit existing urban areas to make them more environmentally sustainable. The built fabric in the historic areas is relatively energy-and resource-inefficient, although embodied energy and carbon is high owing to the long working life of buildings. At the same time the existing buildings, because of their use, have high energy demands. Guiding retrofitting requires an integrated urban design and management approach at the district or neighbourhood scale that addresses both buildings and urban spaces. A methodology is outlined that meets the needs of cultural preservation while facilitating retrofitting of resource-efficient systems.

AB Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been applied to a typical block of flats located in Barcelona, Spain to evaluate environmental impacts during the construction phase. The aim of this paper is to develop and apply several criteria for the building sector that help decision making at the design and construction stages, thereby allowing the selection of sustainable building materials, reducing the environmental impact of the materials used, minimizing the amount of waste generated, and increasing the percentage of this waste that is recycled.
   From a life cycle perspective during the construction phase, results showed that regarding to environmental impact of global warming potential, there was a total emission of 1.19E+01 kg CO2 equiv. m(-2) y(-1) (referred to m(2) of horizontal constructed area) of which about 85% was during the fabrication, while the rest was due to the energy consumed (8%), transport (6%) and waste management (1%).
   When analysing the whole building, the total waste obtained in the construction phase was 4.56E+01 kg m(-2) of which rest of materials account for 84% (internal and external walls 30%, architectural finishing 23% and foundations and basement 19%) and packaging waste represents 16% (roofing 31%, structural frame 22%, architectural finishing 15% and internal and external walls 10% of the total waste).
   Finally, in this paper we compare the different combinations of real construction scenarios for external and internal walls while taking into account the environmental and economic aspects and also three different systems of waste management: landfill, incineration and recycling have been evaluated.

AB In order to advance the scientific understanding of carbon exchange with the land surface, and contribute to quantitative-based US climate change policy interests, quantification of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (the primary greenhouse gas), at fine spatial and temporal scales, is essential. Known as the 'Hestia Project', this pilot study has quantified all fossil fuel CO2 emissions down to the scale of individual buildings, road segments and industrial/electricity production facilities on an hourly basis for the greater Indianapolis region, IN, USA. Here, we describe the method used to quantify the on-site fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the residential and commercial sectors. By downscaling the Vulcan Project's 2002 county-level commercial and residential fossil fuel CO2 emissions, we quantified the CO2 emissions for all building structures using a combination of multiple datasets and energy simulation. At the landscape scale, the spatial variation in CO2 emissions is driven by building density, height and type. Within the urban core, larger emissions are driven by the larger amounts of energy consumed per unit floor area. The resulting dataset and corresponding methods will be of immediate use to city environmental managers and regional planning agencies, enabling the analysis of alternative strategies to lower fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The results obtained here will also be a useful comparison to atmospheric CO2 monitoring efforts aimed at constraining the land surface net carbon exchange via atmospheric sampling.

AB Decreasing the human impact on the atmosphere will necessitate active management of terrestrial carbon pools and greenhouse gas fluxes. Biospheric greenhouse gas emission mitigation measures such as increasing forest area and increasing forest biomass density, build-up of soil carbon and avoided emissions from deforestation offer cost-efficient solutions while in the long run they are limited by land availability, saturation, and concerns about their permanence. Biomass can also be used to produce low greenhouse gas intensive materials, feedstock for energy production and if combined with carbon capture and sequestration it can offer permanent negative emissions. Although most terrestrial management options appear as competitive mitigation measures from an economic point of view, issues of governance remain most contentious as they induce competition for land and other ecosystem services.

AB Building on previously introduced concepts and software, we constructed an interlinked system of models, called an "integrated model project," for assessing integrated effects of supply-side and demand-side technologies and policies for carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation in urban areas. We used the integrated model project to evaluate scenarios that included introduction of a solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine topping cycle (SOFC/GT) as a supply-side technology and reduction of electricity demand by energy conservation and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) cells in residential and commercial buildings as a demand-side measure in Tokyo, Japan. Modeling results indicate that integrating multiple supply-side and demand-side countermeasures can result in more effective mitigation of CO2 emissions. In particular, although separately a moderate CO2 tax and the SOFC/GT technology do not produce large CO2 mitigation, the combination of the two with PV installation could result in a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2050. Cancellation effects of combinations of supply-side and demand-side measures were also seen between supply-side SOFC/GT systems and demand-side rooftop PV cells, effects that might not be apparent without the integrated environmental assessment approach that we have adopted. An integrated environmental assessment approach using tools such as those described in this article could help researchers to assess these kinds of dynamic, nonlinear effects, which would not be predicted by conventional linear, "additive" approaches.

TI The effects of future climate change on heating and cooling demands in
   office buildings in the UK
SO BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB As climate change predicts hotter summers and warmer winters in the next 100 years, buildings designed now as well as many existing buildings will need to cope with the future climate. The aim for building designers should be to provide buildings with comfortable environments for occupants without using excessive heating or cooling energy, which will exacerbate carbon emissions. This is particularly important for office buildings, as these are more susceptible to the effects of warmer temperatures, with their relatively high levels of internal heat gains. The productivity of occupants can also be affected if conditions of the workplace are not ideal. Using climate change data from UKCIP02 based on HadRM3 for three main sites in the UK (London, Manchester and Edinburgh), test reference years were selected for 2020s, 2050s and 2080s under various scenarios.(1) Using a second-order room model, future energy usage for heating and cooling were estimated for office buildings complying with various editions of the UK Building Regulation, as a test of the buildings' age against the effects of climate change. The findings show that the fall in heating energy demand is approximately equalled to the rise in cooling demand as a result of climate change up to the 2080s in Heathrow, Manchester and Edinburgh. Natural ventilation alone would not be able to provide enough summer cooling in the UK in the near future. New office buildings, complying with 2002 Building Regulations, perform significantly better than older ones, and their energy and CO2 emissions remain relatively constant with climate change. However, most of the existing office buildings in the UK are older buildings with lower standards of specification, and the challenge is to make these perform more efficiently. Retrofitting them to have similar properties to the 2002 Building Regulations will be sufficient to cope until 2080s, and increasing the 'weight' of the building enclosure will reduce the amount of cooling required. This paper also demonstrates that for all-air systems, it will be essential for fans to be sized correctly for the increasing cooling load with future climate.
   Practical application: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study and understanding to how various different office buildings in the UK will cope with climate change, especially how climate change will affect the heating and cooling loads, as well as the associated CO2 emissions as a result of meeting the thermal demands. Using a second-order model, this study simulates an office room for three main UK locations, Heathrow (London), Manchester and Edinburgh, under respective climate change data for 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, comparing their thermal energy consumptions with current weather data. Apart from testing the office room with different orientations, construction thermal 'weight' and different future climate scenarios, the office room was also made to comply with various Building Regulations, which determine the permitted maximum U-values and glazing area of the external envelope, and the type of glazing used. This represents the office buildings currently in the building stock in the UK, and the analyses conducted are to examine how each will perform in the 21st century. The results from this study would be useful for building designers to know which aspects will affect energy consumption and thus CO2 emissions most in the future, and what should be done with the existing building stock, where most buildings were built to with higher U-values and single glazing, to make them perform efficiently in the face of a warmer climate. Would retro-fitting be adequate, or would they need to be demolished and re-built? As mechanical cooling becomes a necessity in the future, the energy required for running the fans also contribute greatly to the total CO2 emissions in office buildings in the future.

AB Because of the needs of sustainable development of the mankind society and natural environment building a renewable energy system is one of the most critical issues that today's society must address. In the new energy system there is a requirement for a renewable fuel to replace current energy carrier. Hydrogen is an ideal secondary energy. Using solar energy to produce hydrogen in large scale can solve the problems of sustainability, environmental emissions, and energy security and become the focus of the international society in the area of energy science and technology. It has also been set as an important research direction by many international hydrogen programs. The Ministry of Science and Technology of China supported and launched a project of National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) - the Basic Research of Mass Hydrogen Production using Solar Energy in 2003 for R&D in the areas of solar hydrogen production. The current status of solar hydrogen production research is reviewed and some significant results achieved in the project are reported in this paper. The trends of development and the future research directions in the field of solar hydrogen production in China are also briefly discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A biomass energy exploration experiment was conducted in Jiangjiazhuang, a typical agro-village in Shandong, China from 2005 to 2009. The route of this study was designed as an agricultural circulation as: crops -> crop residues -> "Bread" forage -> cattle -> cattle dung -> biogas digester -> biogas/digester residues -> green fertilizers -> crops. About 738.8 tons of crop residues are produced in this village each year. In 2005, only two cattle were fed in this village and 1.1% of the crop residues were used as forage. About 38.5% crop residues were used for livelihood energy. 24.5% were discarded and 29.7% were directly burned in the field. Not more than three biogas digesters were built and merely 2250 m(3) biogas was produced a year relative to saving 1.6 tons standard coal and equivalent to reducing 4.3 tons CO2 emission. A total of US$ 4491 profits were obtained from cattle benefit, reducing fossil energies/chemical fertilizer application and increasing crop yield. After 5 years experiment, cattle capita had raised gradually up to 146 and some 62.3% crop residues were used as forage. The percentages used as livelihood energy, discarded and burned in the field decreased to 16.3%, 9.2% and 9.8%, respectively. Biogas digesters increased to 123 and 92,250 m(3) biogas was fermented equal to saving 65.9 tons standard coal and reducing 177.9 tons CO2 emission. In total US$ 60,710 profits were obtained in 2009. In addition, about 989.9 tons green fertilizers were produced from biogas digesters and applied in croplands. The results suggested that livestock and biogas projects were promising strategies to consume the redundant agricultural residues, offer livelihood energy and increase the villagers' incomes. Biogas production and utilization could effectively alleviate energy crisis and CO2 emission, which might be a great contribution to reach the affirmatory carbon emission goal of the Chinese government on Climate Conference in Copenhagen in 2009.

AB Whereas current building related life cycle energy and carbon assessment in China has typically focused on either the national building stock or the single building level, this paper attempts to evaluate life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions at the level of Chinese residential small district (RSD). This paper discusses a case study of RSD in order to illustrate the way of measuring material, energy and water flows at this spatial level with transparent assessment boundary. Results indicate that evaluating the RSD as a whole, rather than building by building, can provide extra decision-making information for various stakeholders such as housing buyers and RSD designers.

AB The building sector is a big consumer of energy and is responsible for a considerable share of the greenhouse gas emissions within most developed countries. Based on the development in underlying drivers and using system analysis methods, the historical development in energy flows in the Norwegian residential building stock, the associated costs and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated. The results show that although a 39% decrease occurred in energy consumption per square metre in the use phase, the total energy consumption increased due to increased stock size. Further, the total energy consumption was substantially dominated by the use phase. The energy-related costs increase even more than energy consumption due to increased energy prices, but the greenhouse gas emissions decrease due to changes in the energy mix. The per-capita results follow the same trends as the aggregated results, whereas there have been larger improvements in the system on a per-square-metre basis. Based on underlying drivers, the model ensures inclusion of development trends that are not easily explained by the direct factors energy efficiency, energy mix and energy prices.Le secteur du batiment est un gros consommateur d'energie et est responsable d'une part considerable des emissions de gaz a effet de serre dans la plupart des pays developpes. n se basant sur l'evolution des facteurs sous-jacents et en utilisant des methodes d'analyse des systemes, sont estimes l'evolution historique des flux d'energie dans le parc bati residentiel norvegien, les couts qui s'y rapportent et les emissions de gaz a effet de serre. Les resultats montrent que, bien qu'une diminution de 39% soit intervenue dans la consommation d'energie par metre carre dans la phase d'utilisation, la consommation totale d'energie a augmente en raison de la taille accrue du parc. En outre, la consommation totale d'energie a ete fortement dominee par la phase d'utilisation. Les couts lies a l'energie augmentent encore plus que la consommation d'energie du fait de l'augmentation des prix de l'energie, mais les emissions de gaz a effet de serre diminuent en raison des changements intervenus dans le mix energetique. Les resultats par personne suivent les memes tendances que les resultats agreges, alors que des ameliorations plus importantes se sont produites dans le systeme sur la base du metre carre. En se basant sur les facteurs sous-jacents, le modele assure l'inclusion de tendances evolutives qui ne s'expliquent pas facilement par les facteurs directs d'efficacite energetique, de mix energetique et de prix de l'energie. Mots cles: parc bati, empreinte carbone, analyse des couts, parc de logements, analyse dynamique des flux de materiaux, empreinte economique, consommation d'energie, efficacite energetique, emissions de gaz a effet de serre.

AB In April 2010 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched the Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program to reduce energy consumption-related CO2 emissions at the city level. This is the world's first cap-and-trade programme to cover buildings in the commercial, industrial and public sectors. Its main aim is to reduce CO2 emissions from energy consumption in existing buildings in urban areas; therefore, it is called an 'urban cap-and-trade programme'. The appropriateness and effectiveness of this demand-side mechanism are examined, as well as the key policy and strategy components for introducing this new mechanism. Crucial factors for the successful introduction of this programme include the implementation of a mandatory reporting programme prior to the cap-and-trade programme and a consultation process involving open discussions among stakeholders for creating a consensus. Actual outcomes of the programme will take several years to assess; however, given the significant impact of growing carbon emissions from existing urban buildings, an urban cap-and-trade mechanism can be a worthwhile action at the level of local governance. Based on these lessons, other cities can consider this urban cap-and-trade scheme as a viable policy instrument.

AB The UK non-domestic sector accounts for 2 million buildings and 19% of national CO2 emissions, representing a significant opportunity for emission reductions. However, substantial improvement of the stock requires a greater understanding of current energy performance characteristics. This paper explores energy consumption in English schools, using data from the Display Energy Certificates (DECs) database. DECs are a key step in understanding the non-domestic stock, incorporating national-scale statistical data, covering bottom-up details of the individual buildings. Significant variations in emissions between primary and secondary schools and academies exist, primarily caused by large differences in electricity consumption. Considering pupil numbers is shown to accentuate the differences, revealing a 47% rise in CO2 emissions per pupil from primary to secondary schools, and a further increase between secondary schools and academies. The extent to which building characteristics, including location, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and size, influence performance has also been evaluated. Location, HVAC and school density are shown to correlate with variations in energy use. Finally, a comparison of current school performance against past data reveals considerable reductions in fossil-thermal energy consumption over the last decade. However, this has been offset by a significant increase in electricity consumption, resulting in rising typical emissions across the school types.

AB What are the limitations of regulatory measures to decrease environmental impacts of buildings? The case of Norway's wood-fired mountain cabins is used to explore whether strict energy-efficiency requirements in building regulations are appropriate and effective. A self-service (holiday) cabin is analysed in three different scenarios. The carbon emissions from the extra material required to meet the new regulations are calculated and compared with the emissions saved by the expected decrease in operational energy demand over a 50-year life cycle. The results show that in all three scenarios the carbon emissions from the extra material use and their transport outweighs the savings from reduced heating. As expected, the frequency of use (occupancy rate) is shown to be an important variable to determine the usefulness of technical upgrading. Alternative measures for decreased environmental impacts are considered. Suggested solutions for long-term reductions in carbon emissions for wood-fired mountain cabins are area efficiency (reduced floor area), low-carbon materials and the reuse of components instead of improved U-values. Regulatory measures that create universal standards for all buildings fail to account for particular circumstances and create revenge effects. Increased flexibility in regulatory mechanisms could reduce these problems.

AB This paper reviews the annual energy and water performance of an aspiring low energy/carbon affordable housing development in southern UK comprising 25 houses heated by a biomass fueled district heating network Electrical heat and water consumption data was collected for all dwellings and more detailed data logging was conducted on a sample of four The data was analysed to benchmark the overall site performance and compare the individual dwellings
   The individual dwellings performed efficiently in terms of electricity heat and water consumption Significant variation was identified between maximum and minimum consumers even when typical performance correlates (i e number of occupants floor area) were accounted for Water consumption varies by a factor of > 7 and heat and electrical consumption by > 3 which given the homogeneous design and specification of the buildings suggested that occupant behaviour was important Site-wide energy consumption and losses (over and above individual dwelling use) reduced energy and carbon emissions performance by 85% and 70% respectively Although energy consumption in UK homes can be substantially reduced the challenge for zero-carbon design is to address issues of total system performance occupant behaviour and whole-building energy performance (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Carbon emitted from urban metabolism constitutes a substantial proportion of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission which is at least partially responsible for the recent global warming Part of the urban carbon emission comes from residential energy consumption Given the ongoing rapid urbanization and strict emission-reduction requirement understanding the urban home energy usage carbon emission (UHEUCE) is of great importance to optimize the sustainability of social and economic developments in China For this reason a survey has been conducted to exam the condition of home energy usage in Xiamen Island SE China This study was based on 340 valid responses and a general linear model for univariate method The analysis showed (1) among the residential building characteristics window thermal insulation has the greatest effect on UHEUCE (2) Construction age and wall thermal insulation could also influence UHEUCE in areas where summer is hot and winter is warm The better heat prohibiting effect of external wall and window as well as the newer construction the more UHEUCE can be generated The survey provided helpful first-hand data for design and planning on urban energy saving emission reduction and for relevant scientific researches (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB There is a growing interest in comparing the energy and consequential carbon embodied in buildings using different methods of construction and alternative materials This paper compares the embodied carbon in a low energy affordable house constructed using a novel offsite panellised modular timber frame system in Norfolk UK with two traditional alternative scenarios A lifecycle assessment (LCA) framework is used to conduct a partial LCA from cradle to site of the construction An inventory of the materials and fossil fuel energy utilised in the construction was used to calculate the primary energy consumed and the associated embodied carbon The embodied carbon was found to be 346 tonnes CO2 for a 3 bedroom semi-detached house 405 kgCO(2) per m(2) of useable floor area When compared with traditional methods of construction the modern methods of construction (MMC) house resulted in a 34% reduction in embodied carbon Despite timber being the predominant structural and cladding material concrete is the most significant material (by proportion) in embodied carbon terms responsible for 36% of materials related embodied carbon (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB For most materials used to provide buildings, infrastructure, equipment and products, global stocks are still sufficient to meet anticipated demand, but the environmental impacts of materials production and processing, particularly those related to energy, are rapidly becoming critical. These impacts can be ameliorated to some extent by the ongoing pursuit of efficiencies within existing processes, but demand is anticipated to double in the next 40 years, and this will lead to an unacceptable increase in overall impacts unless the total requirement for material production and processing is reduced. This is the goal of material efficiency, and this paper aims to stimulate interest in the area. Four major strategies for reducing material demand through material efficiency are discussed: longer-lasting products; modularisation and remanufacturing; component re-use: designing products with less material. In industrialised nations, these strategies have had little attention, because of economic, regulatory and social barriers, which are each examined. However, evidence from waste management and the pursuit of energy efficiency suggests that these barriers might be overcome, and an outline of potential mechanisms for change is given. In bringing together insights into material efficiency from a wide range of disciplines, the paper presents a set of 20 open questions for future work. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a modelling analysis of the role different urban forms might play in reducing building CO2 emissions. The study was based on a residential building in a Cairo neighbourhood under summer conditions and developed a base case urban layout covering an area of 1 km(2). Three alternative urban strategies were then created around the same residential building. The software package EnviMet was used to assess external microclimate and thermal comfort conditions in each urban layout. Localised weather files were then created as inputs to the dynamic thermal modelling package DesignBuilder, which predicted the CO2 emissions associated with mechanical cooling to achieve comfort in the building. It was possible to observe some differences in CO2 emissions as a result of the different urban forms.

AB School buildings constitute a major part of the non-residential building stock, though due to their operational characteristics, they represent a low percentage of the overall energy balance of the building sector. Although health and productivity of pupils and teachers is strongly affected by the indoor environmental quality of their school, poor indoor air quality has been reported in published literature, even so for recently constructed school buildings. The same applies for the energy consumption, with large amounts of energy being wasted because no energy saving measures are applied for the operation of schools. This paper presents the outcome of a study on the energy performance of Hellenic school buildings. The general features of the contemporary building stock are presented along with the results from an energy survey in 135 Hellenic schools. The derived energy consumption benchmarks are compared with published literature. Finally, the energy performance and indoor environmental quality of a representative sample of schools in metropolitan Athens are assessed in a holistic approach to the "energy efficiency - thermal comfort - indoor air quality" dilemma. The IEQ assessment was based on an objective evaluation by monitoring crucial indoor conditions and a subjective occupant evaluation using standardized questionnaires. The potential of several energy conservation measures is evaluated in terms of energy savings and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions along with the related payback periods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI MODULAR ECOTECHNOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE: A Response to The Demands of the

AB Constant change in current market and social conditions has triggered the demand for a more adaptable building stock. The capacity to assume and accommodate change has thus become a new requirement for buildings. At the same time, there is a growing demand for more environmentally conscious buildings. New protocols, building codes, and certification systems are becoming stricter regarding buildings' CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and other environmental aspects. The current building industry fails to satisfy these two demands; conventional buildings rarely enable change, unless undergoing complex renovations, and rarely consider environmental features beyond mandatory legislation. In this context, this paper proposes Modular Ecotechnological Architecture as a response to both demands. The basis is an integrated design that looks at energy, water, and materials' efficiency altogether, combined with a modular industrialized building system. The system allows buildings to grow or reduce in size according to their needs, with little impact for their inhabitants, enabling versatility for a variety of uses within the same space and over time. This paper presents the concept of this new building system together with the technical, building code-related, and economic challenges encountered throughout recent experimental projects.

AB This study examines how consumers select ecologically efficient water heaters in Japan. Energy conservation in household water heating is increasingly important for reducing an amount of CO2 emission, because the share of water heating in household energy consumption is approximately 30%. Recently, Japanese households have widely used ecologically efficient electric heat pump water heaters (Eco Cute) or gas-fired water heaters (Eco Jozu). The total number of such efficient water heaters sold in Japan was more than 2.5 million at the end of 2008. This study investigates various factors and impacts of marketing strategy for promoting the appliances in Japan. We apply mixed and nested logit models to a disaggregated choice data on water heaters from 2004 to 2008. This study considers retail energy prices, a government financial support and marketing activities as important factors for appliance selection. In addition, we consider consumers' housing attributes such as floor space and age of building. This empirical study finds two business implications. One of the two implications is that an increase in an energy price may enhance a choice probability of Eco Cute and Eco Jozu because a price increase invites consumer's consciousness on energy conservation so that a cost reduction on energy consumption becomes essential in a use of the efficient appliances. The other implication is that marketing activities, especially by recommendations from sales representatives and/or housing suppliers, are important for consumer behaviors. The other important findings are discussed in this study. This business experience in Japan is useful to the other countries where ecologically efficient water heaters are not popular at the current moment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Comparative analysis of the energy and carbon balances of wood vs. non-wood products is a complex issue. In this paper we discuss the definition of an appropriate functional unit and the establishment of effective system boundaries in terms of activity, time and space, with an emphasis on the comparison of buildings. The functional unit can be defined at the level of building component, complete building, or services provided by the built environment. Energy use or carbon emissions per unit of mass or volume of material is inadequate as a functional unit because equal masses or volumes of different materials do not fulfil the same function. Activity-based system boundaries include life cycle processes such as material production, product operation, and post-use material management. If the products compared are functionally equivalent, such that the impacts occurring during the operation phase are equal, we suggest that this phase may be dropped from the analysis allowing a focus on material flows. The use of wood co-products as biofuel can be analytically treated through system expansion, and compared to an alternative of providing the same energy service with fossil fuels. The assumed production of electricity used for material processing is another important energy-related issue, and we suggest that using marginal production data is more appropriate than average production. Temporal system boundaries include such aspects of the wood life cycle as the dynamics of forest growth including regeneration and saturation, the availability of residue biofuels at different times, and the duration of carbon storage in products. The establishment of spatial boundaries can be problematic, because using wood-based materials instead of non-wood materials requires more land area to capture solar energy and accumulate biomass. We discuss several possible approaches to meet this challenge, including the intensification of land use to increase the time rate of biomass production. Finally, we discuss issues related to scaling up an analysis of wood substitution from the micro-level to the macro-level of national, regional or global.

AB Insulation is one of the most effective methods intended for reducing energy consumption in both heating and cooling of buildings. Selecting the right materials and determining the optimum insulation thickness in building insulation application is an important issue. In 2000, the "Thermal Insulation Requirements for Buildings" was enacted in Turkey, energy saving by limiting the energy amount used for heating in buildings being the target. In this study, the effect of the alteration of windows and exterior wall areas on the heating energy requirement of the building and on the optimum insulation thickness has been examined by using P-1-P-2 method. The study has been carried out for four degree-day regions of Turkey for various insulation materials, glazing areas, and fuel types: the results have been presented in charts. In the rest of this study, effects of different insulation thicknesses and fuel on fuel consumption and thereby on emissions of pollutants such as CO2 and SO2 are evaluated. For example, in the building where XPS (extruded polystyrene foam) insulation material and natural gas are used and where the ratio of glazing area to exterior wall area is 0.2 (glazing area percentage), energy saving for the four regions has been found to be 13.996, 31.680, 46.613, and 63.071 $/m(2), respectively, and the payback period of investment has been found to be 2.023, 1.836, 1.498, and 1.346 years, respectively. The emissions of CO2 are decreased by 50.91% for the cases in which optimum insulation material (XPS) and natural gas are used. The emissions of CO2 and SO2 are decreased by 54.67% for the cases in which optimum insulation material (XPS) and fuel oil are used. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SECTOR
AB Residential building energy use is an important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and in the United States represents about 20% of total energy consumption. A number of previous macro-scale studies of residential energy consumption and energy-efficiency improvements are mainly concerned with national or international aggregate potential savings. In this paper we look into the details of how a collection of specific homes in one region might reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with particular attention given to some practical limits to what can be achieved by upgrading the existing residential building stock. Using a simple model of residential, single-family home construction characteristics, estimates are made for the efficacy of (i) changes to behavioral patterns that do not involve building shell modifications; (ii) straightforward air-infiltration mitigation measures, and (iii) insulation measures. We derive estimates of net lifetime savings resulting from these measures, in terms of energy, carbon emissions and dollars. This study points out explicitly the importance of local and regional patterns in decision-making about what fraction of necessary regional or national emissions reduction might be accomplished through energy-efficiency measures and how much might need to concentrate more heavily on renewable or other carbon-free sources of energy.

AB The seasonal and hourly variation of electricity grid emissions and building operational energy use are generally not accounted for in carbon footprint analyses of buildings. This work presents a technique for and results of such an analysis and quantifies the errors that can be encountered when these variations are not appropriately addressed. The study consists of an hour-by-hour analysis of the energy used by four different variations of a five-story condominium building, with a gross floor area of approximately 9,290 square meters (m(2)), planned for construction in Markham, Ontario, Canada. The results of the case studied indicate that failure to account for variation can, for example, cause a 4% error in the carbon footprint of a building where ground source heat pumps are used and a 6% and 8% error in accounting for the carbon savings of wind and photovoltaic systems, respectively. After the building envelope was enhanced and sources of alternative energy were incorporated, the embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were more than 50% of the building's operational emissions. This work illustrates the importance of short-time-scale GHG analysis for buildings.

ID ENERGY
AB Based on the need to reduce CO2 emissions and minimize energy dependency, the EU Member States have set ambitious energy policies goals and have developed respective, specific regulations, in order to improve the energy performance of the building sector. Thus, specific measures regarding the buildings' envelope, the use of efficient HVAC technologies and the integration of renewable energy systems are being constantly studied and promoted. The effective combination of these three main aspects will consequently result in maximum energy efficiency. Germany has played a key role in this development, with intensive work focusing in the improvement of the energy behaviour of the residential building stock. In this paper, the use of radiative heating systems placing special emphasis on infrared is being studied as part of the energy renovation of residential buildings from the 1970's. This is done by applying an integrated assessment model to evaluate specific interventions regarding the improvement of the energy behaviour of the buildings' envelope and the use of radiative heating systems, based on a thorough Life Cycle Analysis according to criteria of energy, economic and environmental performance, as well as thermal comfort.

ID GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; INPUT-OUTPUT; DEMAND
AB Hindering urban sprawl is one of the main goals for contemporary urban planning. Urban density is considered crucial in climate change mitigation since it reduces automobile dependence and decreases unit sizes, for example. This letter analyzes the effect of density in a city context. In the study the Finnish capital Helsinki is divided into two areas of different urban densities: the high density downtown area and the more scarcely populated suburbs. The study is a continuation of a recently published study on the implications of urban structure on carbon emissions, and analyzes further the main finding of the first study-that higher urban density might have negligible or even reverse effect on the per capita carbon emissions. Similarly to the previous study, a consumption based tiered hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is employed in order to produce a comprehensive assessment, free of territorial boundaries and system cutoffs typical of traditional LCAs. Based on the findings of the previous study, it is hypothesized that when assessing city level carbon dioxide emissions from a wider, consumer oriented LCA perspective, increased urban density may not necessarily reduce carbon emissions. Surprisingly, the study finds that carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions are substantially higher in the dense downtown area than in the surrounding suburbs, which is suggested to imply that the increased consumption due to the higher standard of living increases emissions more than the higher density is able to reduce them. The results demonstrate that, while increasing urban density can be justified from a number of ecological, social and economic viewpoints, density is not necessarily a key parameter in the particular case of climate change. In cities like Helsinki, where wealth is concentrated in the downtown area, climate policies should give higher priority to the energy consumption of buildings, to alternative energy production and distribution modes, as well as to low carbon consumption within the city.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; INPUT-OUTPUT
AB The cities merit special attention in global warming since they produce up to 80% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Even though this has been widely acknowledged, only few papers exist that have studied cities holistically from a demand, i.e., consumption, perspective. The study presents a detailed analysis of the carbon footprint of two metropolitan cities from a consumption perspective. With the analysis of consumer carbon footprints (carbon consumption), the distribution of emissions in the key source categories is presented and compared.
   The study utilizes Finnish consumer survey data by cities, regional emission data for key processes, and general emission data to produce a hybrid LCA model for a holistic assessment of city-level greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption perspective.
   The study results showed the carbon consumption to be 13.2 t CO2e per person in Helsinki with a 17,400 a,not sign annual consumption expenditure and 10.3 t CO2e per person in Porvoo with a 15,900 a,not sign annual consumption expenditure, respectively. The dominant carbon sources for metropolitan living are heat and electricity, building and property, private driving, and services. Within the cities, some significant differences were found. The carbon emissions from energy consumption are 4.5 t CO2e for an average consumer in Helsinki, whereas an average consumer in Porvoo only causes 2.0 t CO2e due to the cleaner energy production in Porvoo. On the other hand, private driving causes 2.0 t CO2e in Porvoo, but only 1.3 t in Helsinki. The overall trip generation in Helsinki is only half of that in Porvoo, and also, the usage of public transport is at a substantially higher level in Helsinki. The current results contradict interestingly some earlier studies in finding that the theoretical carbon-reducing influence of city density is overridden with other factors, such as the type of energy production, energy efficiency of the housing stock, and increased use of services. In our study, Helsinki represents a metropolitan area with a denser structure and a more efficient public transport system, but still consuming around 25% more carbon emissions than the other city in the metropolitan area, Porvoo. The sensitivity analysis showed that even with the normalization of the key parameters between the two cities, the main finding still holds.
   The evaluation of the carbon footprint of cities from the consumption perspective, instead of a more traditional production perspective, seems to offer an interesting new insight into the carbon footprints of the cities. It identifies similar key sources of carbon as production-oriented studies but further emphasizes the significance of the utilized services in the carbon footprint evaluations. In the future, the carbon footprint of services, especially in the service-intensive economies and cities that tend to outsource their manufacturing and carbon emissions, should be further examined since they cause an ever increasing proportion of the carbon consumption of consumers.

AB The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is mainly caused by the differences in the thermal behaviour between urban and rural settlements that are associated with the thermal properties of urban materials, urban geometry, air pollution, and the anthropogenic heat released by the urban activities. The UHI has a serious impact on the energy consumption of buildings, increases smog production, while contributing to an increasing emission of pollutants from power plants, including sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and suspended particulates.
   This study presents the applicability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and learning paradigms for UHI intensity prediction in Athens, Greece. The proposed model is tested using Elman, Feed-Forward and Cascade neural network architecture. The data of time, ambient temperature and global solar radiation are used to train and test the different models. The prediction accuracy is analyzed and evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Buildings account for nearly 50% of all greenhouse gases globally. While this has been widely recognized, the GHG mitigation strategies have traditionally concentrated on reducing the use phase emissions, as over 90% of the emissions are generated during the use phase according to several studies. However, two current developments increase the importance of the construction phase emissions and the embodied emissions of the building materials. Firstly, the improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings directly increase the relative share of the construction phase emissions. Secondly, the notification of the temporal allocation of the emissions increases the importance of the carbon spike from construction. While these perspectives have been noted, few studies exist that combine the two perspectives of the construction and the use phase. In this paper, we analyze the implications of low-carbon residential construction on the life cycle emissions of a residential area with a case study. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the temporal allocation of the emissions is taken into account, the construction phase emissions can hinder or even reverse the carbon mitigation effect of low-carbon buildings for decades.

AB Passive ventilation systems are being increasingly proposed as an alternate to mechanical ventilation systems because of their potential benefits in terms of operational cost, energy requirement and carbon dioxide emission. Solar chimney is an excellent passive ventilation system which relies on natural driving force, that is, the energy from the sun. A significant amount of research work has been done on solar chimney since the 1990s. This article presents an overview of solar chimney research that has taken place in the last two decades. The review focuses on two main areas of research the effects of geometry and inclination angle on the ventilation performance of a solar chimney. The experimental investigations of solar chimney have dominated the existing literature. However, numerical modelling of solar chimney using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique has attracted increasing attention. Moreover, this review found that solar chimney as a passive ventilation strategy has not been fully understood. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Zero energy balance and zero on-site CO2 emission housing
   development in the Mediterranean climate
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article
DE Passive houses; Zero energy buildings; Zero emissions buildings
AB Zero energy balance (ZEB) is an essential and paramount topic in building design. The paper addresses this important research area with special regard to the Mediterranean climate.
   To deal with ZEB in architecture, a final design proposal for a new housing development in the peri-urban context of Tricase - a town located in the south of Italy - is presented and used for energy investigation. With reference to this pilot case study, the paper highlights that high performing and zero energy balance buildings cannot be reached by technology alone, but by the search for an integrated design combining passive tools (high thermal mass brick wall structures - as an evolution of the traditional stone construction of the region, high reflective materials, solar shading devices, ventilation strategies, etc.) with solar and wind energy micro-generation.
   Results show that zero energy balance and zero local CO2 emission houses in the Mediterranean climate present high levels of feasibility, which can be simply achieved by energy-efficient solutions using local materials and traditional construction processes, thus resulting into high quality performing buildings within recognisable urban environments.

SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE Potential for energy savings; Standard wood-framed houses; Thermal
   insulation; CO2 emission; Arctic climate
AB The paper gives an account of the potential and need for energy saving in standard family detached and semi-detached wooden houses in Greenland. It is based on studies of house construction compared with Building Regulation requirements and the spread of buildings over time. In the climatic conditions of Greenland, there is considerable potential for energy saving in houses due to their construction, shape and condition. To estimate the total potential for energy saving and thus reducing CO2 emissions, we carried out a detailed investigation of three typical standard semi-detached family houses (type 18D). Temperature, relative humidity and air tightness were measured, and thermal bridges were determined from drawings, visual inspection, and by using a thermal camera. The findings show a current energy consumption of up to 383 kWh/(m(2) a) for heating, poor air tightness, a large number of thermal bridges, and high indoor temperatures. We demonstrate a potential for a reduction in CO2 emission by a factor of 10. Finally, the paper describes a practical way of reducing thermal bridges significantly, increasing air tightness, upgrading insulation and adding mechanical ventilation to approximately half of the housing stock without changing the architectural expression or having to relocate the occupants during the renovation.

TI Low carbon housing refurbishment challenges and incentives: Architects'
   perspectives

ID ENERGY EFFICIENCY; HOMES
AB The UK has a legally binding commitment to reduce CO(2) levels by 80% by 2050 relative to the 1990 emissions baseline. The existing housing stock, which accounts for approximately 30% of total UK energy demand, has the potential to provide significant opportunities for this reduction; however, currently there are no legislative measures driving widespread low carbon housing refurbishment (LCHR) design and construction. Architects have a decisive role to move forward the LCHR agenda owing to their leadership and significant involvement in the initial briefing, conceptual and design development phases of a project, regardless of project procurement types and project sizes. Hence, the aim of this research is to investigate the key challenges and incentives for achieving LCHR in England from architects' perspectives.
   The research adopted a triangulated methodological approach, consisting of a desk study, postal questionnaires, and follow up semi-structured interviews. The questionnaires and interviews were executed amongst a wide geographical sampling frame of architects in England with previous housing refurbishment experience. The research concluded that high capital costs for micro-generation technologies and energy efficient materials; disparity in VAT between new build and refurbishment; and the complexity of the UK existing housing stock are the most considerable LCHR challenges. In contrast, the research indicated that a tax rebate; removal of the VAT difference between new build and refurbishment; increased research to produce affordable micro-generation technologies; and increased government supplied low carbon programmes were identified by the participants as the key incentives to drive the LCHR agenda.

AB A new generator portfolio planning model is described that is capable of quantifying the carbon emissions associated with systems that include very high penetrations of variable renewables. The model combines a deterministic renewable portfolio planning module with a Monte Carlo simulation of system operation that determines the expected least-cost dispatch from each technology, the necessary reserve capacity, and the expected carbon emissions at each hour. Each system is designed to meet a maximum loss of load expectation requirement of 1 day in 10 years. The present study includes wind, centralized solar thermal, and rooftop photovoltaics, as well as hydroelectric, geothermal, and natural gas plants. The portfolios produced by the model take advantage of the aggregation of variable generators at multiple geographically disperse sites and the incorporation of meteorological and load forecasts. Results are presented from a model run of the continuous two-year period, 2005-2006 in the California ISO operating area. A low-carbon portfolio is produced for this system that is capable of achieving an 80% reduction in electric power sector carbon emissions from 2005 levels and supplying over 99% of the annual delivered load with non-carbon sources. A portfolio is also built for a projected 2050 system, which is capable of providing 96% of the delivered electricity from non-carbon sources, despite a projected doubling of the 2005 system peak load. The results suggest that further reductions in carbon emissions may be achieved with emerging technologies that can reliably provide large capacities without necessarily providing positive net annual energy generation. These technologies may include demand response, vehicle-to-grid systems, and large-scale energy storage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Global warming; Degree days; CO2 equivalent emission factor
ID CONSUMPTION
AB The housing sector is a major consumer of energy. Studies on the future energy demand under climate change which also take into account future changes of the building stock, renovation measures and heating systems are still lacking. We provide the first analysis of the combined effect of these four influencing factors on the future energy demand for room conditioning of residential buildings and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany until 2060. We show that the heating energy demand will decrease substantially in the future. This shift will mainly depend on the number of renovated buildings and climate change scenarios and only slightly on demographic changes. The future cooling energy demand will remain low in the future unless the amount of air conditioners strongly increases. As a strong change in the German energy mix is not expected, the future GHG emissions caused by heating will mainly depend on the energy demand for future heating. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE Energy efficiency; Climate change mitigation; Optimization
AB Costs and benefits of building energy efficiency are estimated as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Pittsburgh, PA and Austin, TX. The analysis includes electricity and natural gas consumption, covering 75% of building energy consumption in Pittsburgh and 85% in Austin. Two policy objectives were evaluated: maximize GHG reductions given initial budget constraints or maximize social savings given target GHG reductions. This approach evaluates the trade-offs between three primary and often conflicting program design parameters: initial capital constraints, social savings, and GHG reductions. Results suggest uncertainty in local stocks, demands, and efficiency significantly impacts anticipated outcomes. Annual GHG reductions of 1 ton CO2 eq/capita/yr in Pittsburgh could cost near nothing or over $20 per capita annually. Capital-constrained policies generate slightly less social savings (a present value of a few hundred dollars per capita) than policies that maximize social savings. However, sectors and end uses targeted for intervention vary depending on policy objectives and constraints. Optimal efficiency investment strategies for some end uses vary significantly (in excess of 100%) between Pittsburgh and Austin, suggesting that resources and guidance conducted at the national scale may mislead state and local decision-makers. Results are used to provide recommendations for efficiency program administrators. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electricity generation sector of Greece, comprising the main contributor of national greenhouse gas emissions, is since 2005 subject to the dictates of National Allocation Plans (NAPs) under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. Based on an analytical recording of the NAP 1st stage (2005-7) results, review of the numerous participating installations' performance is first carried out, while following, evaluation of installations' ability to satisfy the targets of the NAP 2nd stage (2008-12) is also undertaken on the basis of verified emissions not taken into account during determination of 2nd stage allowances. According to the results obtained, unless a bundle of measures is implemented by the local State, serious violation of NAP allowances is expected for the 2nd stage already in force, while as it accrues, of critical importance for satisfaction of both NAP allowances and additional national energy targets is the large scale penetration of renewable energy sources.

AB Modeled carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions from an urban area are validated against direct eddy-covariance flux measurements. Detailed maps of modeled local carbon-dioxide emissions for a 4 km(2) residential neighborhood in Vancouver, BC, Canada are produced. Inputs to the emission model include urban object classifications (buildings, trees, land-cover) automatically derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and optical remote sensing in combination with census, assessment, traffic and measured radiation and climate data. Different sub-models for buildings, transportation, human respiration, soils and vegetation were aggregated. Annual and monthly CO2 emissions were modeled on a spatial grid of 50 m for the entire study area. The study area overlaps with the source area of a micrometeorological flux tower for which continuous CO2 flux data (net exchange) were available for a two-year period. The measured annual total was 6.71 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) with significant seasonal differences (16.0 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Aug vs. 22.1 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Dec correlated with the demand for space heating) and weekday-weekend differences (25% lower emissions on weekends attributed to traffic volume differences). Model results were weighted using the long-term turbulent source areas of the tower. Annual total modeled (7.42 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) and measured emissions agreed within 11%, but show more substantial differences in wind sectors dominated by traffic emissions. Over the year, agreement was better in summer (5% overestimation by model) vs. winter (15% overestimation), which is partially attributed to climate differences unaccounted for in the building energy models. The study shows that direct CO2 flux measurements based on the EC approach - if sites are carefully chosen - are a promising method to validate fine-scale emission inventories/models at the block or neighborhood scale and can inform further model improvements.

ID ELECTRICITY
AB The development towards more energy efficient buildings, as well as the expansion of district heating (DH) networks, is generally considered to reduce environmental impact. But the combined effect of these two progressions is more controversial. A reduced heat demand (HD) due to higher energy efficiency in buildings might hamper co-production of electricity and DH. In Sweden, co-produced electricity is normally considered to displace electricity from less efficient European condensing power plants. In this study, a potential HD reduction due to energy efficiency measures in the existing building stock in the Swedish city Linkoping is calculated. The impact of HD reduction on heat and electricity production in the Linkoping DH system is investigated by using the energy system optimisation model MODEST. Energy efficiency measures in buildings reduce seasonal HD variations. Model results show that HD reductions primarily decrease heat-only production. The electricity-to-heat output ratio for the system is increased for HD reductions up to 30%. Local and global CO2 emissions are reduced. If co-produced electricity replaces electricity from coal-fired condensing power plants, a 20% HD reduction is optimal for decreasing global CO2 emissions in the analysed DH system.

AB Cities are responsible for a large part of primary energy demand and emissions worldwide. Hence, the use of renewable energy sources (RES) is becoming a key issue in the international debate on the sustainability of urban development models. Most of the literature addresses this issue by focusing on metropolitan areas, disregarding analyses that can support urban design at smaller scales. This paper presents and applies a method to estimate and compare the potential supply of RES and the energy demand of buildings (EDB) at local scale by: (a) performing a spatial estimation of the potential exploitation of RES; (b) performing a spatial estimation of EDB, by considering their characteristics and location, as well as the urban morphology and the settlement design; (c) assessing the spatial congruence between supply and demand patterns. Four RES were analyzed: solar irradiation, ground-source heat, wood biomass and hydropower from existing drinking water supply systems. Suitability maps for each energy source were first developed, and then combined to obtain a composite map, which was eventually compared with the EDB map. The method is based on spatial and statistical analyses conducted in a geographical information system (GIS), using data layers coming from a range of different sources. The case application is represented by an alpine municipality in Trentino, northern Italy. Even though the proposed approach is affected by uncertainties and data scarcity, it showed how datasets and tools available today can be used to provide spatial estimates of RES suitability for exploitation, supporting the selection of areas that are intrinsically suitable for the design of low-carbon settlements.

AB The purpose of this research is twofold: first, to evaluate how occupant behavior in a neutral environment influences the overall greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption of multi-family apartment buildings, and second: to establish which activities associated with housing companies produce the most greenhouse gas emissions. The research comprised of a multiple cases of housing companies dating from the late 1960s and located in the Finnish capital Helsinki. The studied housing companies represent the least energy efficient third of the Finnish residential building stock, approaching obligatory large scale refurbishments. The analysis is conducted in two phases with a so called hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) technique. Using the technique, both economic and metric consumption data are analyzed to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions generated by activities associated with housing. In line with previous research, the study identifies heating energy as the single most significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The results also show that the carbon load associated with housing activities makes up one third of an individual resident's overall carbon footprint. Contrary to often stated belief, the study indicates that occupant behavior has only limited effect on the energy consumption and, consequently, carbon emissions derived from housing, particularly when multi-family housing connected to district heating is concerned. However, apartment size seems to have a two-way impact, the smallest and the largest being the least energy efficient. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solar cooling technology is environmentally friendly and contributes to a significant decrease of the CO2 emissions which cause the green house effect. Currently, most of the solar cooling systems commonly used are the hot water driven lithium bromide absorption chillers. According to the operating temperature range of driving thermal source, single-effect LiBr/H2O absorption chillers have the advantage of being powered by ordinary flat-plate or evacuated tubular solar collectors available in the market. In this paper, besides the review of the existing theoretical and experimental investigations of solar single-effect absorption cooling systems, some new design options with regard to solar collectors, auxiliary energy systems and cooling modes were introduced. And then, other main types of solar absorption cooling systems based on double-effect, half-effect and two-stage absorption chillers were summarized. For buildings with high amounts of cooling load and limited installation area, solar-powered double-effect absorption cooling systems may be considered on condition that the direct irradiation is high enough. Half-effect absorption chillers and two-stage absorption chillers seem to be more suitable for air-cooled solar absorption cooling systems in hot and dry regions which are short of water. It is highly recommended to study the standardised design guidelines according to different areas for the purpose of widespread applications of solar cooling systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB With 60% of the population younger than 26 years, a need of about 1.5 million residential units per year for the next 5 years and the necessity of mitigating its rapidly growing GHG emissions together with adapting cities to the expected drastic effects of climate change, Iran's urban agglomerations are facing tremendous challenges now and in the future. The paper presents interim findings of the German-Iranian research initiative "Young Cities" (2005-2013) that investigates approaches for these immense challenges. The project aims at developing energy-efficient and resilient housing in a real-life pilot project, the 35 ha area in Hashtgerd New Town in the Tehran province. The article explores the framing conditions and the master plan of this pilot and identifies four key planning strategies. Besides applying climate-sensitive urban form, the project stresses the need to develop culturally adapted building typologies for reduced heating and cooling, an efficient public transport in a mixed and dense urban structure and integrated water and energy systems on the neighborhood level. Simulations of these planning approaches have proven a significant reduction of energy- and resource consumption and the capacity of the design to adapt to (a potentially changing) environment. These promising strategies for energy-efficiency and resilience were transferred into a legally binding comprehensive plan commissioned in October 2010, though the major challenge in the second phase of the project (2011-2013) will be making these innovations a built reality.

AB The resilience of the current Spanish residential building stock to increased temperatures is modelled. Homogenized daily temperature data recorded at 50 Spanish meteorological stations for the periods 1950-1979 and 1981-2010 were used to investigate anticipated climate warming on the Spanish residential building stock by means of the degree-day method. Impacts on residential buildings were investigated for three different future time periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100) for three representative Spanish provincial capitals. Future climate change scenarios comprising two statistical downscaling methods, three general circulation models and two carbon emission scenarios were used to project local climate. Results show that 72% of current residential building stock in Spain is thermally unprotected. In addition, the energy demand for heating the building sector in Spain is expected to decrease by between 30% (Barcelona, B2 scenario) and 36% (Valencia, A2 scenario) by 2100, while the respective energy demand for cooling could increase by between 107% (Valencia, B2 scenario) and 296% (Madrid, A2 scenario) by 2100. To increase resilience to higher winter and summer temperatures, strategies for modifying the built environment are needed, particularly for the role of building codes and standards.

AB Long-term measurements of carbon dioxide flux (F-c) and the latent and sensible heat fluxes were performed using the eddy covariance (EC) method in Beijing, China over a 4-yr period in 2006-2009. The EC setup was installed at a height of 47 m on the Beijing 325-m meteorological tower in the northwest part of the city. Latent heat flux dominated the energy exchange between the urban surface and the atmosphere in summer, while sensible heat flux was the main component in the spring. Winter and autumn were two transition periods of the turbulent fluxes. The source area of F-c was highly heterogeneous, which consisted of buildings, parks, and highways. It was of interest to study of the temporal and spatial variability of F-c in this urban environment of a developing country. Both on diurnal and monthly scale, the urban surface acted as a net source for CO2 and downward fluxes were only occasionally observed. The diurnal pattern of F-c showed dependence on traffic and the typical two peak traffic patterns appeared in the diurnal cycle. Also F-c was higher on weekdays than on weekends due to the higher traffic volumes on weekdays. On seasonal scale, F-c was generally higher in winter than during other seasons likely due to domestic heating during colder months. Total annual average CO2 emissions from the neighborhood of the tower were estimated to be 4.90 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) over the 4-yr period. Total vehicle population was the most important factor controlling the inter-annual variability of F-c in this urban area.

AB Over the past decade Dubai's energy demand has increased in sync with the rapid urban development and population growth of the UAE. In particular the residential villa stock has grown by more than 300% from 20,000 villas in 2000 to over 60,000 villas in 2009. In order to limit energy consumption, the local authorities introduced building legislation (2001 and 2003) that prescribes minimum insulation levels for external walls and roofs. The resulting constructive solutions focus on the use of a mid-plane insulated prefabricated block to attain the prescribed maximum wall U value (0.57 W/m(2) K). however the reinforced concrete frame typically remains non-insulated, and thus introduces significant thermal bridges in the building envelope. This work investigates the impact of this thermal bridging effect on the building's energy consumption by modeling (hourly simulation using DesignBuilder/EnergyPlus) the energetic performance of a series of typically applied insulation strategies, both for buildings in the initial design stage, and in retrofit mode. The simulation model is calibrated against collected consumption data and experimental infiltration measurements of the actual building. Simulation results show that with appropriate external wall insulation strategies alone, energy savings of up to 30% are realized. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Energy-efficient retrofitting of existing building is a huge contribution to the sustainability of the society since building energy consumption takes more than one fourth of total energy consumption. The application of external shading system could block out unwanted radiant heat gain, thus reduces the cooling load of the air-conditioning system. During the assessment of energy-efficient retrofitting projects, apart from annual saving figures and economic payback time, energy and CO2 emission payback periods should also be taken as indispensable references. In this paper, a methodology is described for analyzing the energy and CO2 emission payback periods of external overhang shading in a university campus in Hong Kong. Result shows that due to requirements of structural strength under typhoon situation, although introducing overhang shading system could reduce almost half of the cooling load in the related area, the energy and CO2 emission payback periods of the project are still unrealistically long. This case study presents an example of multi-disciplinary approach being not only important to the energy-efficient retrofitting but also necessary for policy making in different climatic and geographic regions.

AB A dynamic analysis of future energy and carbon flows (2000-2050) is performed on the aggregated residential building stock in Norway. The basis for the analysis is a dynamic material flow analysis of floor areas and the main building materials. By adding energy intensity assumptions for space heating, water heating, domestic electrical appliances and embodied energy in construction materials, the future corresponding delivered energy demand is calculated. This forms the basis for life cycle estimation of the future direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The predicted demand for delivered energy in 2025 will increase by 24.0% and 12.5% above those for 2000 and 2010, respectively, and then remain stable towards 2050. Energy savings per unit of floor area are counterbalanced by growth in the building stock. The very high influence of energy technology assumptions within the electricity generation market is demonstrated, along with the large differences between using attributional and consequential life cycle assessment principles in the calculation of future emissions. Future electricity demand met by marginal power generation technologies in the European market will yield substantially higher GHG emissions. The simulations demonstrate the policy, strategy, and practical challenges in achieving significant long-term energy and GHG emission reductions from the residential building stock in a country with a rapidly growing population.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Despite significant efforts involving design and regulatory targets, no significant reduction of overall primary energy consumption and carbon emissions has been realized in the European building stock since 1975. The improved performance of new buildings has been offset by the increased size of the stock and other rebound effects. Significant gaps exist in the data and understanding of building stocks' composition and dynamics as well as of the actual energy impacts of refurbishment. Most methods to address existing buildings and stocks are inappropriate as they are conceptually derived from new construction. The discussion about the relation between demand reduction and decarbonization of the energy supply needs to be extended specifically to consider existing buildings. New types of target systems based on the continuous control of effective performance are considered. An alternative scenario is proposed: long-term incremental changes and the formulation of technological options. This is based on continuous monitoring and systematic risk evaluation. The conservation of the physical, economic, social and cultural value of the building stock can only be reached through a comprehensive incremental transformation of the stock. A research agenda is explored to support this strategy.

AB At present, many urban areas in Mediterranean climates are coping with water scarcity, facing a growing water demand and a limited conventional water supply. Urban design and planning has so far largely neglected the benefits of rainwater harvesting (RWH) in the context of a sustainable management of this resource. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the most environmentally friendly strategy for rainwater utilization in Mediterranean urban environments of different densities.
   The RWH systems modeled integrate the necessary infrastructures for harvesting and using rainwater in newly constructed residential areas. Eight scenarios were defined in terms of diffuse (D) and compact (C) urban models and the tank locations ((1) underground tank, (2) below-roof tank, (3) distributed-over-roof tank, and (4) block tank). The structural and hydraulic sizing of the catchment, storage, and distribution subsystems was taken into account using an average Mediterranean rainfall, the area of the harvesting surfaces, and a constant water demand for laundry. The quantification of environmental impacts was performed through a life cycle assessment, using CML 2001 Baseline method. The necessary materials and processes were considered in each scenario according to the lifecycle stages (i.e., materials, construction, transportation, use, and deconstruction) and subsystems.
   The environmental characterization indicated that the best scenario in both urban models is the distributed-over-roof tank (D3, C3), which provided a reduction in impacts compared to the worst scenario of up to 73% in diffuse models and even higher in compact ones, 92% in the most dramatic case. The lower impacts are related to the better distribution of tank weight on the building, reducing the reinforcement requirements, and enabling energy savings. The storage subsystem and the materials stage contributed most significantly to the impacts in both urban models. In the compact density model, the underground-tank scenario (C1) presented the largest impacts in most categories due to its higher energy consumption. Additionally, more favorable environmental results were observed in compact densities than in diffuse ones for the Global Warming Potential category along with higher water efficiencies.
   The implementation of one particular RWH scenario over another is not irrelevant in drought-stress environments. Selecting the most favorable scenario in the development of newly constructed residential areas provides significant savings in CO2 emissions in comparison with retrofit strategies. Therefore, urban planning should consider the design of RWH infrastructures using environmental criteria in addition to economic, social, and technological factors, adjusting the design to the potential uses for which the rainwater is intended.
   Additional research is needed to quantify the energy savings associated with the insulation caused by using the tank distributed over the roof. The integration of the economic and social aspects of these infrastructures in the analysis, from a life cycle approach, is necessary for targeting the planning and design of more sustainable cities in an integrated way.

AB As the area of urban forests rapidly decrease in size, there is growing interest in green roofs as the only alternative to urban forests. This study aimed to evaluate economic and environmental effects of functional improvement in elementary school facilities by applying various improvement scenarios based on green roof systems (GRSs) with the combination of energy-saving measures (ESMs). A total of 16 possible improvement scenarios from the combination of GRSs and ESMs were developed, and energy modeling (Energy Plus ver. 6.0), based on the (i) characteristics of building, (ii) regional climate, and (iii) season, was performed. Using the energy modeling result, the amount of the CO2 emission reduction by energy savings and the CO2 absorption by GRSs' plants was calculated, and a life cycle cost analysis was conducted with the consideration of the life cycle CO2 (LCCO2). The results of this study can be used (i) to introduce the most appropriate ESMs for the specific facility when applying GRSs, (ii) to decide which location is proper to implement GRSs considering characteristics of regional climate, and (iii) to select energy- and cost-efficient elementary school when applying GRSs.

ID CO2; SEQUESTRATION; STORAGE
AB As high CO2-emitting utilities and other industries move toward implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to manage greenhouse gas emissions, more and more CO2 will become available as a resource for multiple applications. CO2 will be a plentiful potential feedstock (carbon source) for many products, including commercial chemicals, plastics, and improved cement. Unfortunately, CO2 is a stable compound with a low energy state and does not readily participate in chemical reactions without added energy. Additionally, the supply of CO2 that may be available as the USA moves toward a carbon-constrained economy far exceeds the current demand for CO2 as a commodity chemical. Thus, identifying candidate chemistries and economically feasible approaches that utilize large amounts of CO2 as a feedstock for high-demand products is very challenging.
   The United States Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), has an active carbon sequestration program. The goal of the CO2 Utilization Focus Area is to identify and develop a suite of technologies that can beneficially use CO2 to produce useful products that can generate revenue to offset capture costs associated with CCS implementation, contribute to CO2 emissions reductions, and reduce the demand for petroleum based feedstocks and products. Currently, projects being supported fall into the categories of (i) enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, (ii) chemicals production, (iii) mineralization processes for building products, and (iv) plastics production. This perspective discusses the current status of CO2 use and presents a review of DOE's program to identify and demonstrate uses for captured CO2.

Total living area is 147264.8 m(2) and daily hot water consumption is 406,7201 what constitutes appreciable potential for substitution of fossil fuels with SWHSs. The dormitory "Karaburma", having one of the highest potential for SWHSs integration according to the established set of criteria, is selected to demonstrate the effects that could be achieved through SWHS integration. Several design options with integrated solar thermal collectors (STCs) were analyzed and evaluated. A multi-criteria compromise ranking method was used for a comprehensive evaluation of the design options and for selection of the optimal one regarding the conflicting criteria: energy performance, economic, ecological, functional and aesthetic aspects. The results are presented and the main factors influencing design are distinguished and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cool roofs, cool pavements, and urban vegetation reduce cooling energy use in buildings, lower local air pollution, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from urban areas. To promote widespread and large-scale implementation of cool roofs to moderate urban heat-island phenomenon, more awareness and understanding of cool roof benefits at the local level is needed. As part of an investigation of strategies to mitigate urban heat-island effects, field data gathered from a monitoring project on cool roofs in India were reviewed. An innovative field-based analytical method was developed to quantify cooling energy savings resulting from the installation of cool roofs on commercial buildings. For buildings monitored in the Metropolitan Hyderabad region, the measured annual energy savings from roof-whitening of previously black roofs ranged from 20 to 22 kWh/m(2) of roof area, corresponding to a cooling energy use reduction of 14-26%. The application of white coatings to uncoated concrete roofs resulted in annual savings of 13-14 kWh/m(2) of roof area, corresponding to cooling energy savings of 10 -19%. The annual direct CO2 reductions associated with the reduced cooling energy use were estimated to be 11-12 kg CO2/m(2) of flat roof area. Additional field work on various building types and locations will help to understand magnitudes of regional or global potential in energy savings and GHG emission reductions from applying cool roofs. Knowledge about quantified cool roof benefits at both the local and regional level may promote the formulation of new policies and programs throughout the world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   Building diagnostics; Office building; Performance mandates; Singapore
AB Although the individual building system has been designed to meet the specific performance criteria, the way people will perceive and react to a total office environment is only known after it is in use and subjected to diagnostic. Evaluation of office space has gone beyond looking at a single building requirement. There exists the need to look at the interrelationship of performance mandates to provide healthy buildings for building occupants and most importantly, to reduce energy consumption during the construction and operation of buildings. This study aims to demonstrate the use of total building performance (TBP) evaluation and diagnostic to assess the performance of an existing office building in Singapore. Two floors of the evaluated high-rise commercial building have been evaluated by using the TBP paradigm. Objective measurements and observations (walkthrough) coupled with occupant survey (subjective measurement) has been conducted. The analysis demonstrates that there is concurrence between the objective and subjective measures, and that the holistic approach of TBP elicited the interrelationships between the performance's mandates and constitutes a sound basis for diagnostics and sustainability improvement. This study is significant because it provides an evaluation tool for ensuring sustainable buildings. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EY.1943-7897.0000056. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

   Mixed-use development; Residents' behavior
AB Energy management for housing, which is responsible for 70% of the energy consumption by buildings, is increasing in importance. This study identified the characteristics of energy consumption in high-rise apartment buildings through a series of case studies and resident surveys. The results were as follows: (1) high-rise apartment buildings can be classified according to whether they are mixed-use or general residential buildings and according to the building shape. (2) In the evaluation of the characteristics of electrical energy consumption according to building use, residents in the mixed-use apartments showed higher behavior of active heating management and more actively adjusted their indoor stay, but they consumed more electricity, particularly in summer, than those living in general residential apartments. (3) For the electric energy consumption characteristics according to the building shape, plate-type buildings consumed less energy than tower-type buildings. And the latter consumed 1.48 times more energy than the former in the electricity for common areas. (4) When evaluating the characteristics of liquefied natural gas consumption according to the building shape, it can be seen that plate-type buildings consumed 10% more gas than tower-type buildings. (5) CO2 emissions in mixed-use buildings were found to be higher than those in general residential buildings. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indentifying common priorities in shared natural resource systems constitutes an important platform for implementing adaptation and a major step in sharing a common responsibility in addressing climate change. Predominated by discourses on REDD + (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) with little emphasis on adaptation there is a risk of lack of policy measures in addressing climate change in the Congo Basin. Forest products and ecosystem services provide security portfolios for the predominantly rural communities, and play major roles in national development programmes in both revenue and employment opportunities. Thus, raising the profile of forests in the policy arena especially in the twin roles of addressing climate change in mitigation and adaptation and achieving resilient development is crucial. Within the framework of the Congo Basin Forests and Climate Change Adaptation project (COFCCA) project, science policy dialogue was conducted to identify and prioritize forest based sectors vulnerable to climate change but important to household livelihoods and national development. The goal of the prioritization process was for the development of intervention in forest as measures for climate change adaptation in Central Africa. Participants constituted a wide range of stakeholders (government, Non Governmental Organizations, research institutions, universities, community leaders, private sectors etc.) as representatives from three countries directly involved in the project: Cameroon, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo. Building on national priorities, four forest related sectors were identified as common priorities at the regional level for focus on climate change adaptation. These sectors included: (1) energy with emphasis on fuel wood and Charcoal; (2) Water principally quality, quantity, accessibility, etc.; (3) Food with emphasis on Non Timber Forest Products, and (4) Health linked to healthcare products (medicinal plants). Using these prioritized sectors, the project focused on addressing the impacts of climate change on local communities and the development of adaptation strategies in the three pilot countries of the Congo Basin region. The four sectors constitute the key for development in the region and equally considered as priority sectors in the poverty reduction papers. Focused research on these sectors can help to inject the role of forests in national and local development and their potentials contributions to climate change adaptation in national and public discourses. Mainstreaming forest for climate change adaptation into national development planning is the key to improve policy coherence and effectiveness in forest management in the region.

TI Quantifying Carbon Mitigation Wedges in US Cities: Near-Term Strategy
   Analysis and Critical Review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

ID ENERGY USE; EMISSIONS; DEMAND; TRAVEL
AB A case study of Denver, Colorado explores the roles of three social actors-individual users, infrastructure designer-operators, and policy actors-in near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in U.S. cities. Energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban design, price- and behavioral-feedback strategies are evaluated across buildings-facilities, transportation, and materials/waste sectors in cities, comparing voluntary versus regulatory action configurations. GHG mitigation impact depends upon strategy effectiveness per unit, as well as societal participation rates in various action-configurations. Greatest impact occurs with regulations addressing the vast existing buildings stock in cities, followed by voluntary behavior change in electricity use/purchases, technology shifts (e.g., to teleconferencing), and green-energy purchases among individual users. A portfolio mix of voluntary and regulatory actions can yield a best-case maximum of similar to 1% GHG mitigation annually in buildings and transportation sectors, combined. Relying solely on voluntary actions reduces mitigation rates more than five-fold. A portfolio analysis of climate action plans in 55 U.S. cities reveals predominance of voluntary outreach programs that have low societal participation rates and hence low GHG impact, while innovative higher-impact behavioral, technological, and policy/regulatory strategies are under-utilized. Less than half the cities capitalize on cross-scale linkages with higher-impact state-scale policies. Interdisciplinary field research can help address the mis-match in plans, actions, and outcomes.

AB In this study, the feasibility of a solar powered absorption cycle under Abu Dhabi's weather conditions is assessed. Utilizing solar energy is very attractive since the cooling requirements are in phase with the solar energy availability. Using solar driven air conditioners would also reduce the dependence on fossil fuel based energy. The proposed system uses evacuated tube collectors to drive a 10 kW(c) ammonia-water absorption chiller. Transient systems simulation of the complete system is carried out in order to select and size different system components. Based on the thermal analysis, the solar air conditioner system has a specific collector area of 6 m(2)/kW(c) and a specific tank volume of 0.1 m(3)/kW(c). The selected system size requires about 47% less electrical energy than the widely spread vapor-compression cycles of the same cooling capacity. In addition, economical analysis is performed for three electricity costs. The collector area is found to be the key parameters in reducing the payback period of the initial investment. Moreover, the proposed system is found to reduce 12 metric tons/year of CO2 emissions due to its energy savings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY EFFICIENCY
LA English

DE Energy efficiency support programmes; Residential buildings; Loan
   guarantee for energy efficiency; Green Investment Scheme; Hungary
AB The residential sector is the largest final energy consumer and is responsible for 30% of total carbon dioxide emissions in Hungary. In order to address the general poor condition of the building stock and resulting inefficiency in energy use, from 1990 onwards, the government and local authorities initiated energy efficiency support programmes in the residential buildings sector. Furthermore, technical assistance and loan guarantee schemes by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) helped to establish a market for financing energy efficiency investments. EU funds also played a role in the modernisation of non-residential buildings. Residential energy efficiency support programmes entered a new phase in 2009 with the start of the Green Investment Scheme (GIS). While Hungary was a front-runner in establishing the legal framework for GIS, the success of early AAU sales (the financing source of the scheme) were overshadowed by reputation concerns in terms of additionality and the disbursement of funds. At the same time the GIS brought with it improved environmental integrity compared to earlier programmes in terms of monitoring and verification of results, establishing a focus on GHG emission reductions in addition to energy savings, and introducing incentives for deeper refurbishment. The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the evolution of energy efficiency support programmes for residential buildings in the Hungarian context, pointing out prevailing problematic elements, as well as areas of improvement and good practice.

AB The use of engineered nanomaterials offers advantages as well as disadvantages from a sustainability perspective. It is important to identify such points as early as possible in order to be able to build on existing strengths, while counteracting disadvantages. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a suitable method to assess the environmental performance of a product or process. But so far studies applying LCA to the area of nanotechnology have been scarce. One reason might be that the LCA framework has a whole list of issues that need further precision in order to be applicable to nanotechnologies: system boundaries and a functional unit have to be chosen in a way that allows one to do a comparison of equal functionalities; adequate and comprehensive life cycle inventory data for engineered nanomaterials are the key on the level of inventory analysis; and the impact assessment step requires a clear definition of the degree of detail on the level of nanoparticle emissions. The LCA studies existing thus far in the area of nanotechnology have barely begun to cover all these aspects. Thus, in order to improve the current situation, the authors propose to go ahead in each of the LCA stages as far as scientific advances allow. For the inventory modelling this means e.g. that comprehensive, transparently documented and quality ensured data of the most important engineered nanomaterials should be collected and made available in a widely-accepted format. Concerning nanoparticle emissions, as many parameters as possible have to be collected pertaining to the production, use, and the disposal phase of these engineered nanomaterials. Furthermore, on the level of impact assessment, relevant physical characteristics have to be identified for a toxicity assessment of nanoparticles and a consensus has to be found for a limited but sufficient number of independent parameters influencing toxicity to be collected.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENERGY
AB Buildings emit much greenhouse gases as large amounts of resources and energy are consumed during their life cycle. CO2 emissions from residential buildings in the Republic of Korea ("Korea" hereinafter) are expected to consistently increase. According to the statistical data, apartment buildings occupy a high portion (86.4%) of residential buildings, and it is expected to maintain a certain level every year due to residential building construction policy of the Korean government. So, apartment buildings are a very important subject of study. This study aims to quantify CO2 emissions emitted by six different size apartment units due to major construction materials consumed in construction. The result shows that CO2 emission of the various construction materials of an apartment unit was estimated to be 569.5 kg-CO2/m(2) on average. The apartment with the area of 84.9 m(2) for a common apartment type in Korea has about 11.8 TOE embodied energy and 45.1 ton-CO2 emission. The CO2 emissions from steel and concrete were 424.2-584.2 kg-CO2/m(2) for apartment units, occupying more than 82% of the total CO2 emissions. The results are valuable for the sustainable design of apartment complexes and are used as technical measures for the CO2 reduction strategy of the building sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Evaluation of several measures to improve the energy efficiency and

SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article
DE Single-family houses; Energy consumption; CO2 emissions; European Union
AB The building sector is responsible for 40% of the energy consumption and 36% of the CO2 emissions in the European Union. The present work investigates how the energy consumption, CO2 emissions and related costs are affected by different measures which can be adopted to satisfy the energy demand in EU single-family houses. To achieve this objective, several types of single-family houses and energy systems are analyzed in three climatic areas. The results show that a high insulation of the house envelope and the implementation of energy systems, which produce heat and electricity from renewable energy sources, are key measures to reduce the energy dependence and CO2 emissions in single-family houses. For heating and cooling systems, the energy systems based on ground coupled heat pumps had the lowest energy consumption but the systems based on district heating and biomass heaters had lower CO2 emissions. An inverse relationship between investment and operational cost is observed. The equipments with higher efficiency and lower CO2 emission have the highest and the lowest investment and operational costs respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern energy access in Africa is critical to meeting a wide range of developmental challenges including poverty reduction and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite having a huge amount and variety of energy resources, modern energy access in the continent is abysmal, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Only about 31% of the Sub-Saharan African population have access to electricity while traditional biomass energy accounts for over 80% of energy consumption in many Sub-Saharan African countries. With energy use per capita among the lowest in the world, there is no doubt that Africa will need to increase its energy consumption to drive economic growth and human development. Africa also faces a severe threat from global climate change with vulnerabilities in several key areas or sectors in the continent including agriculture, water supply, energy, etc. Low carbon development provides opportunities for African countries to improve and expand access to modern energy services while also building low-emission and climate-resilient economies. However, access to finance from different sources will be critical in achieving these objectives. This paper sets out to explore the financial instruments available for low carbon energy access in Africa including the opportunities, markets and risks in low carbon energy investments in the continent.

AB Energy consumption in buildings accounts for a significant percentage of total world energy utilization. Great efforts have been made in order to reduce fossil energy consumption and mitigate its depletion by means of energy efficiency directives. The national transposition of such directives generates regional regulations that might be counterproductive if it is not clear which one is more restrictive. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential of energetic savings of the dwellings in Catalonia and its economic impact, according to different scenarios of efficiency that have been defined according to current regulations at state and autonomic level. To achieve this objective, thirteen typologies of dwellings have been defined in order to categorize the stock of buildings in Catalonia. Simulations with LIDER software have been carried out in order to obtain the heating and cooling demand for each typology of dwelling in different climatic zones and orientations. The economic impact of each scenario has been stated as well. We show that the best normative scenario is not the regional but the national one, and only when full limitations imposed by the state regulations are fulfilled. Following the latter 6.4% reduction in CO2 emissions would be achieved, whereas following the former gives us only 2.8% reduction for year 2015. These results have been obtained considering a base case scenario without any energetic measures implemented for the same time line. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the heights of high-rise buildings increase, their building area and elevation area also increase, consequently increasing their yearly energy consumption. Energy efficiency has become an even more important issue, especially when glass is used for a building's exterior. In this study, the life-cycle cost (LCC) of the exterior glass of high-rise buildings was analyzed from the perspective of energy efficiency and CO2 emissions. First, the LCC was analyzed according to changes in the selected types of glass. Reflective + Low-E (Type 1), double Low-E + Argon (Type 2), and triple Low-E + Argon (Type 3), which satisfy green building certification criteria and were used in the past for high-rise buildings in Korea, were selected as the exterior glass types. These types of exterior glass were applied to a case building and compared with the Low-E glass that was the existing glass type of a case building. The economic benefit of selected glasses for 40 years was greater in the order of Type 1, Type 3, and Type 2 compared to the existing glass. Second, these types of glass were applied to each orientation of the building. By changing the glass according to building orientation it is shown that in the east, west, and north, Type 1 was most economical, whereas Type 3 was most economical in the south. The results of this study will contribute to the improvement of energy efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, and cost efficiency of future high-rise buildings. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000502.

AB Stock modelling, based on representative archetypes, is a promising tool for exploring areas for resource and emission reductions in the residential sector. The use of archetypes developed using detailed statistical analysis (multi-linear regression analysis, clustering and descriptive statistics) rather than traditional qualitative techniques allows a more accurate representation of the overall building stock variability in terms of geometric form, constructional materials and operation. This paper presents a methodology for the development of archetypes based on information from literature and a sample of detailed energy-related housing data. The methodology involves a literature review of studies to identify the most important variables which explain energy use and regression analysis of a housing database to identify the most relevant variables associated with energy consumption. A statistical analysis of the distributions for each key variable was used to identify representative parameters. Corresponding construction details were chosen based on knowledge of housing construction details. Clustering analysis was used to identify coincident groups of parameters and construction details; this led to the identification of 13 representative archetypes. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

DE Urban energy systems; Optimization; Retrofit
ID SYSTEMS; CITIES; COMFORT
AB Local authorities often rely upon urban energy and carbon modelling tools to develop mitigation policies and strategies that will deliver reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper the UK example of Newcastle-upon-Tyne is used to critique current practice, noting that important features of urban energy systems are often omitted by bottom-up tools including interactions between technologies, spatial disaggregation of demand, and the ability to pursue over-arching policy goals like cost minimization. An alternative optimization-based approach is then described and applied to the Newcastle case, at the scale of both the whole city and the South Heaton district, and using Monte Carlo techniques to address policy uncertainty. The results show that this new method can help policy makers draw more robust policy conclusions, sensitive to spatial variations in energy demand and capturing the interactions between developments in the national energy system and local policy options. Further work should focus on improving our understanding of local building stocks and energy demands so as to better assess the potential of new technologies and policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Household energy demand; CO2 emissions; Urban form
AB This study aims to investigate the relationship between household space heating energy use and urban form (land use characteristics) for the Greater Dublin Region. The geographical distributions of household energy use are evaluated at the Enumeration Districts (ED) level based on the building thermal balance model. Moreover, it estimates the impact of possible factors on the household space heating consumption. Results illustrate that the distribution profile of dwellings is a significant factor related to overall heating energy demand and individual dwelling energy consumption for space heating. Residents living in compact dwellings with small floor areas consume less energy for space heating than residents living in dwellings with big floor areas. Moreover, domestic heating energy demand per household was also estimated for two extreme urban development scenarios: the compact city scenario and the dispersed scenario. The results illustrate that the compact city scenario is likely to decrease the domestic heating energy consumption per household by 16.2% compared with the dispersed city scenario. Correspondingly, the energy-related CO2 emissions could be significantly decreased by compact city scenario compared with the dispersed city scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While buildings are often credited as accounting for some 40% of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the construction phase is typically assumed to account for only around one tenth of the overall emissions. However, the relative importance of construction phase emissions is quickly increasing as the energy efficiency of buildings increases. In addition, the significance of construction may actually be much higher when the temporal perspective of the emissions is taken into account. The construction phase carbon spike, i. e. high GHG emissions in a short time associated with the beginning of the building's life cycle, may be high enough to question whether new construction, no matter how energy efficient the buildings are, can contribute to reaching the greenhouse gas mitigation goals of the near future. Furthermore, the construction of energy efficient buildings causes more GHG emissions than the construction of conventional buildings. On the other hand, renovating the current building stock together with making energy efficiency improvements might lead to a smaller construction phase carbon spike and still to the same reduced energy consumption in the use phase as the new energy efficient buildings. The study uses a new residential development project in Northern Europe to assess the overall life cycle GHG emissions of a new residential area and to evaluate the influence of including the temporal allocation of the life cycle GHG emissions in the assessment. In the study, buildings with different energy efficiency levels are compared with a similar hypothetical area of buildings of the average existing building stock, as well as with a renovation of an area with average buildings from the 1960s. The GHG emissions are modeled with a hybrid life cycle assessment. The study suggests that the carbon payback time of constructing new residential areas is several decades long even when using very energy efficient buildings compared to utilizing the current building stock. Thus, while increasing the overall energy efficiency is important in the long term, the construction of new energy efficient buildings cannot be used as a means to achieve the short term and medium term climate change mitigation goals as cities and governments often suggest. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the carbon spike from construction and its implications, the climate change mitigation strategies should set reduction targets for the construction phase emissions alongside the ones for the use phase, which currently receives almost all of the attention from policy-makers.

LA English
DT Article

ID ENERGY SYSTEM; MARKET; CHP
AB This paper presents the results of a municipal energy system analysis where the role of district heating is emphasised. A simplified energy system model based on linear programming is used to study the impact of introducing biomass based district heating in the community. Based on existing situation, some cases are outlined where district heating with varying degree is included as an option. Based on the assumed input data the analysis shows that district heating can play an important role in reshaping the municipal energy system which is dominated by electricity and fossil fuels. A substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can be achieved by replacing fossil fuels and electricity. There is also a possibility to improve local environment by replacing inefficient wood combustion which gives high values of particulate emissions and other harmful compounds.
   Unlike individual heating, district heating is associated with distribution costs that may be critical to its profitability (particularly in low heat demand areas). In addition, one should keep in mind the need for investment in possible building conversion (switching to hydronic heating system) measures. In relation to today's energy costs, the total distribution cost of district heat appears to be at such a low level that this together with the assumed fuel prices and investment cost could provide favourable conditions for district heating. If viable, there is also potential for local combined heat and power production. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global climate change is making California's mild Mediterranean climate significantly warmer, and a substantial impact on building energy usage is anticipated. Studies on building cooling and energy demand have been inaccurate and insufficient regarding the impacts of climate change on the peak load pattern shifts of different kinds of buildings. This study utilized archived General Circulation Model (GCM) projections and statistically downscaled these data to the site scale for use in building cooling and heating simulations. Building energy usage was projected out to the years of 2040, 2070, and 2100. This study found that under the condition that the cooling technology stays at the same level in the future, electricity use for cooling will increase by 50% over the next 100 years in certain areas of California under the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)'s worst-case carbon emission scenario, A1F1. Under the IPCC's most likely carbon emission scenario (A2), cooling electricity usage will increase by about 25%. Certain types of buildings will be more sensitive to climate change than others. The aggregated energy consumption of all buildings including both heating and cooling will only increase slightly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To resist large deformability demand due to earthquake attack, high-strength concrete (HSC) columns of tall buildings in high seismicity regions are designed to be fully ductile by providing heavy confining steel in the plastic hinge region. However, in areas of low to moderate seismic risks, where the columns are subjected to reduced seismic demand, the-same provision of confining steel causes unwanted increase in construction cost (i.e. less cost effective) and embodied energy or carbon level of the structures (i.e. less environmentally friendly). Especially for ultra-HSC columns, the required confining steel will be too large to be provided in the plastic hinge region, which adversely affects the concrete placing quality. To alleviate the problem, a series of experimental tests on HSC columns that contain less confining steel than that of fully ductile columns in the plastic hinge region was carried out to investigate their performance under medium axial load and flexure. From the obtained test results, it was found that these columns perform better than the HSC columns without sufficient confining steel. Also, the drift of these columns can reach about 3% and the respective curvature ductility factors of about 10.

AB The international literature has paid significant attention to presenting China as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world, despite having much lower per-capita emissions than the global average. In fact, the imbalance of economic development leads to diversity in GHG emissions profiles in different areas of China. This paper employs a common methodology, consistent with the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) approved by the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), to estimate CO2 emissions of four Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas from 2004 to 2010. The results show that the CO2 emissions of all four cities are still rising and that secondary industries emit the most CO2 in these cities. By comparing these data with the inventory results of two European cities, this paper further reveals that Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas contribute much higher per-capita emissions than their European competitors. Furthermore, the per-capita CO2 emissions of the residential sector and private transport in these Chinese cities are growing rapidly, some of them approaching the levels of European cities. According to these findings, several policy suggestions considering regional disparities are provided that aim to reduce the CO2 emissions of highly urbanized areas in China. (C) 201 2 Elsevier Ltd.

One possibility to combine the two is through linking Non-ETS offset project-based crediting schemes in the form of Joint Implementation or domestic offset (DO) projects with the EU ETS. Linking would allow non-ETS offset project-based CO2 credits to be traded within the ETS market. This paper discusses the merits and drawbacks of the implementation of a DO scheme in the built environment in the Netherlands. The built environment can be characterised as a sector with a great diversity and significant energy savings potential. Emphasis is paid on the modalities for estimating energy savings under DO projects. The authors discuss if next to existing EU, national or regional policies in the Netherlands, DO could spur initiatives in sub-sectors or market areas that are difficult to reach with conventional policy instruments. Thus, despite the existing policy framework in this sector, there could be still space for DO to reach the untapped energy savings potential. DO can support activities and technologies that are not covered by other policy instruments, either because they are not part of the instruments focus or are above the minimum requirements of the incumbent policy targets. It is expected that some lessons from this study in the Netherlands can be taken into account also by other countries facing similar market circumstances, which have implemented several policy instruments and are considering DO schemes as an alternative for capturing part of the untapped energy saving potential in their end use sectors. Another possible advantage of DO is that is has the potential to reduce public spending on existing policy goals, when it is considered in conjunction with existing public financing instruments. In order to tap into this potential, there are a series of hurdles in place, like additionality and the current CO2 price levels, while transaction and administration costs must be kept low.

AB In the context of ambitious commitments to reduce CO2 emissions in industrialised countries, the domestic sector will play a crucial role as one of the biggest sources of end-use emissions. In the past, several studies have aimed to analyse the costs and the technical feasibility of CO2 emissions reduction in the domestic stock. This paper addresses the issue of abatement costs and potentials in the housing stock from a systems perspective in order to capture interactions and interdependencies with the wider energy system. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves for the UK residential sector are derived based on the energy systems model UK MARKAL in combination with decomposition analysis. The results indicate that it is cost-effective to implement conservation measures, as well as increase the share of district heat and biomass for space and water heating. The decarbonisation of electricity and heat dominates the lower part of the residential sector MAC curve up to 50 pound/t CO2. The MAC curve is found to be robust to fossil fuel prices, while more expensive electricity and limited availability of biomass significantly reduce the abatement potential. The results underline the need to assess emissions reduction from a systems perspective to capture system-wide interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB The newly-released Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) 2009 [1] underpins all energy calculations for Building Regulations compliance and Code for Sustainable Homes ratings for domestic buildings in the UK. A newly-developed three-stage optimisation framework is applied to the outputs of SAP for a case study concerning a 2-bed mid-level flat. Firstly a comprehensive full-factorial Design-of-Experiments analysis is performed to determine the significance of each input to the outputs of SAP (carbon emissions, running costs and overheating risk). This allows many of the inputs to be disregarded as non-significant. Next a multi-objective optimisation algorithm is applied to all significant variables to simultaneously optimise regulated carbon emissions versus capital and running costs, constrained by limits on overheating and roof area. Finally a more detailed multi-objective optimisation using greater precision is conducted on all variables that exhibit complex behaviour, i.e. which do not take a single value for all optimum solutions. Information is obtained concerning parameter significance and optimal parameter settings, which is presented as graphical design guidance using the process of 'innovisation'. This will assist engineers in achieving high-performing, cost-effective designs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scope of this study is, to examine the impacts of improvements made on building envelope and roof on existing buildings, to evaluate the waste gas emissions caused by the construction properties and energy consumption types of existing buildings. Calculations are done by creating model building that represents all existing building of which has 7.8, m height, 156 m(2) floor area, 3 stored and wooden framed single-glazed window system. Heating and cooling periods are taken up separately in different degree-day sections and optimum insulation thicknesses are obtained between 6 cm and 16 cm. Heating-cooling period of model building is 7 months-5 months for 1st DD section, 8 months-3 months for 2nd DD section, 10 months-2 months for 3th DD section and heating period is 10 months, no cooling period for 4th DD section. It is adopted that heating load is satisfied by natural gas, fuel-oil and coal and cooling load by electricity. Emission saving values which are dependent to fuel type and heating cooling period are determined between 28 % and 80 % for CO2, 58 % and 80 % for SO2 emissions. Results show that, dealing heating and cooling periods together in the analysis, produce effective solutions in order to ensure comfort conditions.

AB Anthropogenic emissions of heat and exhaust gases play an important role in the atmospheric boundary layer, altering air quality, greenhouse gas concentrations and the transport of heat and moisture at various scales. This is particularly evident in urban areas where emission sources are integrated in the highly heterogeneous urban canopy layer and directly linked to human activities which exhibit significant temporal variability. It is common practice to use eddy covariance observations to estimate turbulent surface fluxes of latent heat, sensible heat and carbon dioxide, which can be attributed to a local scale source area. This study provides a method to assess the influence of micro-scale anthropogenic emissions on heat, moisture and carbon dioxide exchange in a highly urbanized environment for two sites in central London, UK. A new algorithm for the Identification of Micro-scale Anthropogenic Sources (IMAS) is presented, with two aims. Firstly, IMAS filters out the influence of micro-scale emissions and allows for the analysis of the turbulent fluxes representative of the local scale source area. Secondly, it is used to give a first order estimate of anthropogenic heat flux and carbon dioxide flux representative of the building scale. The algorithm is evaluated using directional and temporal analysis. The algorithm is then used at a second site which was not incorporated in its development. The spatial and temporal local scale patterns, as well as micro-scale fluxes, appear physically reasonable and can be incorporated in the analysis of long-term eddy covariance measurements at the sites in central London. In addition to the new IMAS-technique, further steps in quality control and quality assurance used for the flux processing are presented. The methods and results have implications for urban flux measurements in dense urbanised settings with significant sources of heat and greenhouse gases. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Barriers and Opportunities Regarding the Implementation of Rooftop
   Eco.Greenhouses (RTEG) in Mediterranean Cities of Europe

ID URBAN; AGRICULTURE; GREENHOUSE; TRANSITION
AB Today 50 percent of the world's population lives in cities. This entails an excessive exploitation of natural resources, an increase in pollution, and an increase in the demand for food. One way of reducing the ecological footprint of cities is to introduce agricultural activities to them. In the current food and agriculture model, the fragmentation of the city and the countryside means energy use, CO2 emissions from transport, and large-scale marketing requirements. Rooftop Eco.Greenhouses (RTEG) consist of a greenhouse connected to a building in terms of energy, water, and CO2 flows; it is a new model for a sustainable production, an eco-innovative concept for producing high quality vegetables and improving the sustainability of buildings in cities. The main objective of this study is to examine the barriers and opportunities regarding the implementation of RTEG in Mediterranean cities in Europe. The work method consisted of discussion seminars involving an interdisciplinary group of experts in the area of agronomy, architecture, engineering, environmental sciences, industrial ecology, and other related disciplines. The barriers and opportunities of RTEG take into account social, economic, environmental, and technological aspects and were determined and analyzed according to three scenarios of implementation: residential buildings, educational or cultural buildings, and industrial buildings. We would highlight the interconnection of the building and the greenhouse as an opportunity of RTEG, making use of water, energy, and CO2 flows between both, as well as the decrease in food transportation requirements. The methodology applied to the study was positive due to the interdisciplinary participation of experts which facilitated a global vision of the implementation of the project.

ID EXCESS WINTER MORTALITY; RETROFITTING HOUSES; ENERGY; INSULATION;
   QUALITY; IMPACT; HOMES
AB Housing is one of the key drivers of energy use and the economy. The lifetime of the building stock is around 80 years, so decisions about constructing new houses, or retrofitting existing houses, have important environmental and economic consequences. The decision to demolish or renovate must also be considered alongside initiatives aimed at fostering social and cultural sustainability. There is growing evidence that the physical aspects of housing and the indoor environment have a direct impact on health through a variety of mechanisms. A number of recent studies have shown that housing interventions to improve thermal properties of the house, and its heating and ventilation have positive impacts on the health of occupants, particularly children and older people and this research has had an impact on policy in a number of countries. Local and central governments have an important role in determining the location and density of housing, as these decisions affect households' transport costs and have an effect on their level of physical activity and obesity, as well as having long-term consequences for carbon emissions. There is a need for more research to quantify these cobenefits of housing interventions on health and carbon reductions, if more rounded and sustainable housing policies are to be implemented.

ID ENERGY
AB Between 1980 and 2007, in the Chinese building sector in urban and rural areas, coal was mainly substituted with electricity and natural gas. Growing income will further increase energy consumption and CO2-emissions in the building sector. Using an econometric model, disaggregated energy demand and related CO2-emissions in the residential sector as well for the whole economy are estimated and forecasted until 2050. In 2009, the Chinese government pledged itself to reduce CO2-intensity by 40%-45% in 2020 compared to 2005. Aim of this article is to assess to which extent the measures in the building sector in China can contribute to this target. Main results of the analysis are: (a) The primary energy source coal was mainly substituted by electricity generated with coal. Apart from convenience gains, the environmental advantages are questionable. (b) Between 2010 and 2050, energy demand in the building sector will grow by 2.0%-4.1% per annum leading to CO2-emissions at least almost tripling from about 560 mill. tons in 2010 to about 1,500 mill. tons in 2050. (c) The energy efficiency gains in the building sector and other sectors of the Chinese economy, however, are not enough to fulfill the national CO2-intensity targets. The reduction of the CO2-intensity of GDP would be 37.2% in the BAU-scenario, and 31.9% in the LOW-scenario. Only in the HIGH-scenario (46.3%), the economy is growing efficient enough relative to the induced CO2-emissions. The remaining CO2-emission reductions could be gained by additional promotion of renewable energies (mainly solar and geo-thermal) in the building sector.

AB Biochar has been presented as a key technology for avoiding dangerous climate change. Pyrolysis converts part of the biomass feedstock into a gaseous fraction, which can be used for energy production. The remaining fraction is char, which is highly stable and resistant to biodegradation. When char is added to soil it increases carbon storage, reduces emissions and improves soil quality. Agricultural residues such as straw, stover and hulls are seen as the most accessible raw material. These residues could also be used as insulation in passive energy housing. Straw bale construction is a relatively simple technology, which has been applied for decades. It can store the carbon of the straw material into walls structure and in the process provides energy efficient housing. The climate benefits from improved energy efficiency depend on local conditions and energy production forms. In this study life cycle assessment was used to compare the climate impacts of biochar production and straw bale construction. On a life cycle perspective, straw bale construction results in higher net carbon storage than biochar production (3.3 t CO(2)eq vs. 0.9 t CO(2)eq/t of straw). However the result was found to be highly dependent on the assumptions on the overall energy efficiency of the replaced building stock. (C) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB The Greek energy system is one of the most carbon intensive energy systems in Europe. Hydrocarbons and solid fuels (lignite) cover over 80% of the final energy demand. The main objective of this work is to build energy scenarios for the future - with a focus on the electricity production system - and explore how these scenarios are reflected in economic, environmental terms and in terms of energy efficiency. The main tool which is used in the scenario analysis is LEAP (Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System). The scenarios are essentially the result of developing "storylines" driven by the uncertainties which cannot be controlled by the analysts or decision makers, and technical and non-technical options the analyst or decision maker may choose from. A set of uncertainties is considered as a possible future or storyline, and one or more options can be selected as a possible strategy. The combination of a storyline and a specific strategy gives a scenario. The main uncertainties for the Greek energy system are identified and various technical options are explored. Rather than using a model which leads to optimum strategies from a set of alternatives, the model in use will apply different strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Buildings are the most important economical sector in the world but also the major contributors of environmental damage, from the sourcing of raw materials through to the energy used for their functioning and to the disposal of their elements once their life cycle comes to an end. Almost half of the UK's carbon emissions come from the use of buildings and houses alone account for more than 30% of all primary energy demand. In an attempt to reduce this impact, the British Government is pushing towards the development of energy efficient and zero carbon buildings, both in new construction and in the existing stock.
   But how is the market receiving such buildings? Are energy efficient buildings gaining a competitive advantage in the current marketplace? In some countries such as The Netherlands, energy efficient houses reach values 2.8% higher on average than normal houses. In the UK the Sustainability Property Index (ISPI) reveals that, for the properties examined in 2010, regular properties delivered a cumulative total return of -10.8%, compared with -14.9% for more energy efficient ones. This is bad news considering the higher capital investment usually needed to achieve zero carbon buildings.
   The current reality in the UK market seems to be that people may not (yet) be willing to pay more rent for energy efficient buildings. As rent and capital value are inexorably linked, whether or not a building is zero carbon does not yet seem to be affecting property value. This paper does not present definitive answers but discusses possible reasons for that through two case studies and their positions in the marketplace, and suggests that the situation may change as energy prices increase and buildings acquire a potential 'earning capacity' through the use of renewable energy technologies and feed-in tariffs. The introduction of Energy Performance Certificates has also started to impact on the market. Could energy efficient buildings become a property sector in their own right in the near future, with premium priced accordingly? Or is simply that we do not yet have an ability to identify from the data whether the market is differentiating? (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A net-zero building application and its role in exergy-aware local
   energy strategies for sustainability

AB Based on two case studies, this paper explores the nexus of exergy, net-zero targets, and sustainable cities as a means of analyzing the role of exergy-aware strategies at the building and district level. The first case study is a premier building in Ankara that is ready to meet the net-zero exergy target. It is also the first building in Turkey to receive the highest Platinum rating in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. A net-zero exergy building (NZEXB) is a building that has an annual sum of net-zero exergy transfer across the building-district boundary. This new target is made possible by lowered annual exergy consumption, (AEXC), and increased on-site production from a bundle of sustainable energy technologies. The modeled results of the building indicate that the reduced AEXC of 60 kW h/m(2) yr is met with on-site production of 62 kW h/m(2) yr. On-site production includes PV and building integrated PV, a micro-wind turbine, combined heat and power, GSHP, and solar collectors. Diversified thermal energy storage tanks further facilitate the exergy supply to meet with the exergy demand. The results of this case study provide key lessons to structure an energy value chain that is more aware of exergy, which are up-scalable to the district level when the bundle of sustainable energy technologies is zoomed out across a larger spatial area. These key lessons are then compared with the second case study of two districts in the south heating network of the city of Stockholm, which was the European Green Capital in 2010. The levels of exergy match in these districts of Stockholm, namely the districts of Hogdalen and Hammarby, is found to be 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. However, there remain several bottlenecks for these districts to reach net-zero targets at the community level. The paper concludes that the NZEXB case study has much to offer as a "building block" to reform the way energy is converted and managed and in this way, to structure an exergy-aware energy value chain for greater sustainability in green cities of the future.

AB Half of the world's annual production of steel is used in constructing buildings and infrastructure. Producing this steel causes significant amounts of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. Climate change experts recommend this amount be halved by 2050; however steel demand is predicted to have doubled by this date. As process efficiency improvements will not reach the required 75% reduction in emissions per unit steel output, new methods must be examined to deliver service using less steel production. To apply such methods successfully to construction, it must first be known where steel is used currently within the industry. This information is not available so a methodology is proposed to estimate it from known data. Results are presented for steel flows by product for ten construction sectors for both the UK and the world in 2006. An estimate for steel use within a 'typical' building is also published for the first time. Industrial buildings and utility infrastructure are identified as the largest end-uses of steel, while superstructure is confirmed as the main use of steel in a building. The results highlight discrepancies in previous steel estimates and life-cycle assessments, and will inform future research on lowering demand for steel, hence reducing carbon emissions.

AB Historic dwellings in the UK make up to 20% of all homes. In the Georgian city of Bath this rises to 30%. These buildings are a mongst the most poorly performing part of the English housing stock in energy use terms, with the lowest SAP rating and highest average annual CO2 emissions.
   The legal aim to reduce CO2 emissions of 80% by 2050 will involve all existing dwellings, including historic buildings. The degree to which proposals to retrofit the UK housing stock can reduce emissions depends on how much energy they currently use, what it is used for and how much CO2 they emit. This paper establishes a benchmark of energy use and CO2 emissions for historic dwellings in Bath.
   This permits comparison of their energy performance against other parts of the housing stock and will facilitate evaluation of potential retrofit adaptations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Improving the efficiency and performance of the UK residential sector is now necessary for meeting future energy and climate change targets. Building performance evaluation and certification (BPEC) tools are vital for estimating and recommending cost effective improvements to building energy efficiency and lowering overall emissions. In the UK, building performance is estimated using the standard assessment procedure (SAP) for new dwellings and Reduced SAP (RdSAP) for existing dwellings. Using a systems based approach we show there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of BPEC tools. In particular, if the building stock is going to meet future energy and climate change targets the system driving building energy efficiency will need to become more efficient. In order to achieve this goal, building performance standards across Europe are compared highlighting the most effective strategies where they are found. It is shown that the large variance between estimated and actual energy performance from dwellings in the UK may be preventing the adoption of bottom-up energy efficiency measures. We show that despite popular belief, SAP and RdSAP do not estimate building energy efficiency but instead attempt to estimate the cost-effective performance of a building and thus create perverse incentives that may lead to additional CO2 emissions. In this regard, the SAP standard confounds cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and environmental performance giving an inadequate estimate of all three policy objectives. Important contributions for improving measurement, analysis, synthesis and certification of building performance characteristics are offered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Domestic solar hot water systems (DSHWS) have been used worldwide for many decades. Activities in this area are usually targeting middle- or upper-class residential dwellings, and solar collector design and sizing is carried out aiming at this market. In developing countries of the sunbelt, however, there is a huge potential for low-cost DSHWS in low-income residential dwellings. We have assessed the technical and economic viability of this technology, both from the electric utility's perspective, and from the standpoint of low-income residential consumers. We have analysed data of 12 months of continuous monitoring of a statistically representative sample of consumers at a low-income residential building in Florianopolis - Brazil (27 degrees S, 1550 kWh/m(2)/year solar irradiation average). We have studied the power consumption of 60 residential units equipped with a commercially available, low-cost DSHWS, and a 30 units control group, where hot water was supplied with the electronic showerhead typical of Brazilian dwellings. Annual electricity savings averaged 38%, and peak-time electricity demand was reduced by 42%. For discount rates of up to 9.5%, this technology is attractive from a utility's perspective for large-scale deployment. The financial benefit from avoided CO2 emissions has limited economic attractiveness, and can only be justified under a large-scale deployment program. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Starting on the 24th of April, 2011, the Romanian government offered to subsidize all potential buyers of electric vehicles, both private and corporate, offering 25% off of the retail price up to 5000 euros with no pollution tax. The Romanian government encourages all governmental institutions to consider buying electric vehicles when deciding to change their existing vehicles stock. This decision is strictly related to the Romanian government's approval of a long-term Energy Strategy, building on the National Energy Strategy for the Medium Term. The government's strategy emphasizes increasing energy efficiency and boosting renewable energy use.
   The first electric vehicles distributed in the Romanian market are the Citroen-C-Zero, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, the Renault Kangoo Z.E. and the Renault Fluence Z.E. The energy consumption of these vehicles was analyzed, considering the CO2 generation characteristics of a Romanian electric power plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), we show that nearly 50% of all carbon emissions caused by private transportation and building operations in Germany can be explained by structural determinants that go hand in hand with infrastructural peculiarities in rural and urban residential areas. Taking the theoretical background of building physics, allometry and increasing returns to scale as a vantage point, this paper analyses the effects of physical concentration e.g. apartment buildings versus bungalows and social compactness e.g. multigenerational versus single households. In contrast to related studies, this perspective reveals that social and physical concentration tend to counteract each other and thus clarifies the intricate interactions between household structure, different infrastructural environments and carbon emissions. A supplementary finding is that the spatial distribution of fuel types plays a large role in explaining lower carbon emissions in urban settlements. This leads us to the conclusion that environmental policy should foster physical concentration in rural and social concentration in urban infrastructural environments.

AB This study examines a scenario for realizing large-scale reductions of operational carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in commercial districts in temperate and tropical zones. In warm climates, energy usage for heating is not dominant in a building's energy usage, and hence, every available emission reduction technology must be fully utilized to achieve a large overall reduction in emissions, as in the scenario examined in this study. The focus is on commercial buildings in Nakanoshima area, a sandbank 3 km long and 50 ha wide, a central business and cultural area in the city of Osaka, Japan. The commercial buildings in Nakanoshima with approximately 1.2 million square meters of total floor area emitted 88 thousand tons of CO2 in 2008. The method used in this paper combines: 1) energy flow analysis, 2) community-scale building performance simulation validated with actual energy consumption and supported by detailed field survey and reference survey, and 3) what-if analysis assuming technological deployment and social change based on a long-term perspective. It enables a comprehensive understanding of how much energy is consumed for what purpose as well as how much energy can be reduced by implementing which technologies and measures. The result showed that approximately 65% emissions of the present operational CO2 emission could be reduced in the coming decades. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the Energy, Carbon and Cost Assessment for Building Stocks (ECCABS) model, which is a bottom-up model to assess energy-saving measures (ESM) and carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation strategies in building stocks. The model is based on a one-zone hourly heat balance that calculates the net energy demand for a number of buildings representative of the building stock and an additional code for the input and output data. The model generates results in terms of net and delivered energy, associated CO2 emissions, and the costs of implementing different ESM. The results are extended to the entire building stock by means of weighting factors. Empirical and comparative validations of the heat-balance modelling of single buildings are presented. The building stock modelling is validated against the current Swedish residential stock, for which the results of the modelling are in agreement with the statistical data. Using the model to assess a number of ESM reveals that the energy usage of the Swedish residential sector can be reduced by 55% and the associated CO2 emissions can be reduced by 63%, with most of the ESM being cost-effective. The applicability of the model to countries other than Sweden is under investigation. 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effective environmental control and energy efficiency in high-technology buildings have become an important subject of investigations across continents since the last decades. This study aims to quantify energy use and associated environmental impact of four high-technology buildings for wafer fabrication in a subtropical region of Asia using life cycle assessment techniques. Wafer fabrication process and its energy and steam consumption were associated with "summer smog," "heavy metals," and "acidification potential" on the environment. All fabs used natural gas, diesel oil, and steam, which together accounted for about 5% of the total energy consumption. Two metrics - production efficiency index (PEI) and the electricity utilization index (EUI) were used to characterize and normalize environmental impact of each of the four high-technology buildings within which dynamic random access memory (DRAM) wafers were manufactured. The GHG emissions in PEI and EUI have declined from 601 g to 367 g (by 39%) and from 28.9 g to 13.7 g (by 53%), respectively, between 1999 and 2007. Energy intensity per unit area of wafer production has increased from 195 to 268 associated with a 37% increase in emission rate of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) from 195 kg to 268 kg (by 73 kg) per unit area of wafers produced.

   domestic stock energy models to provide improved policy analysis

ID EMISSION REDUCTION; BUILDING SECTOR; CONSUMPTION
AB The UK has a target for an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 from a 1990 base. Domestic energy use accounts for around 30% of total emissions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing models and modelling techniques and indicates how they might be improved by considering individual buying behaviour. Macro (top-down) and micro (bottom-up) models have been reviewed and analysed. It is found that bottom-up models can project technology diffusion due to their higher resolution. The weakness of existing bottom-up models at capturing individual green technology buying behaviour has been identified. Consequently, Markov chains, neural networks and agent-based modelling are proposed as possible methods to incorporate buying behaviour within a domestic energy forecast model. Among the three methods, agent-based models are found to be the most promising, although a successful agent approach requires large amounts of input data. A prototype agent-based model has been developed and tested, which demonstrates the feasibility of an agent approach. This model shows that an agent-based approach is promising as a means to predict the effectiveness of various policy measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we employ Life-Cycle Assessment to evaluate the energy-related impacts of photovoltaic systems at different scales of integration, in an arid region with especially high solar irradiation. Based on the electrical output and embodied energy of a selection of fixed and tracking systems and including concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) and varying cell technology, we calculate a number of energy evaluation metrics, including the energy payback time (EPBT), energy return factor (ERF), and life-cycle CO2 emissions offset per unit aperture and land area. Studying these metrics in the context of a regionally limited setting, it was found that utilizing existing infrastructure such as existing building roofs and shade structures does significantly reduce the embodied energy requirements (by 20-40%) and in turn the EPBT of flat-plate PV systems due to the avoidance of energy-intensive balance of systems (BOS) components like foundations. Still, high-efficiency CPV field installations were found to yield the shortest EPBT, the highest ERF and the largest life-cycle CO2 offsets under the condition that land availability is not a limitation. A greater life-cycle energy return and carbon offset per unit land area is yielded by locally-integrated non-concentrating systems, despite their lower efficiency per unit module area.

TI Synergic and conflicting issues in planning underground use to produce

ID EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS; AREA
AB In densely populated countries there is a growing and compelling need to use underground for different and possibly coexisting technologies to produce "low carbon" energy. These technologies include (i) clean coal combustion merged with CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS); (ii) last-generation nuclear power or, in any case, safe nuclear wastes disposal, both "temporary" and "geological" somewhere in Europe (at least in one site): Nuclear wastes are not necessarily associated to nuclear power plants; (iii) safe natural gas (CH4) reserves to allow consumption also when the foreign pipelines are less available or not available for geopolitical reasons and (iv) "low-space-consuming" renewables in terms of Energy Density Potential in Land (EDPL measured in [GW h/ha/year]) as geothermics. When geothermics is exploited as low enthalpy technology, the heat/cool production could be associated, where possible, to increased measures of "building efficiency", low seismic risks building reworking and low-enthalpy heat managing. This is undispensable to build up "smart cities". In any case the underground geological knowledge is prerequisite.
   All these technologies have been already proposed and defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA) Road Map 2009 as priorities for worldwide security: all need to use underground in a rational and safe manner. The underground is not renewable in most of case histories 110,14 IEA recently matched and compared different technologies in a unique "Clean Energy Economy" improved document (Paris, November 16-17, 2011), by the contribution of this vision too (see reference).
   In concert with "energy efficiency" improvement both for plants and buildings, in the frame of the "smart cities" scenarios, and the upstanding use of "energy savings", the energetic planning on regional scale where these cities are located, are strategic for the year 2050: this planning is strongly depending by the underground availability and typology. Therefore, if both literature and European Policy are going fast to improve the concept of "smart cities" this paper stresses the concept of "smart regions", more strategic than "smart cities", passing throughout a discussion on the synergic and conflicting use of underground to produce energy for the "smart regions" as a whole.
   The paper highlights the research lines which are urgent to plan the soundest energy mix for each region by considering the underground performances case by case: a worldwide mapping, by GIS tools of this kind of information could be strategic for all the "world energy management" authorities, up to ONU, with its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the G20, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) and the European Platforms such as the "Zero Emissions Fossil Fuel Power Plants" (EU-ZEP Platform), the Steel Platform, the Biomass Platform too. All of these organizations agree on the need for synergistic and coexistent uses of underground for geological storage of CO2, CH4, nuclear waste and geothermic exploitation.
   The paper is therefore a discussion of the tools, methods and approaches to these underground affecting technologies, after a gross view of the different uses of underground to produce energy for each use, with their main critical issues (i.e. public acceptance in different cases).
   The paper gives some gross evaluation for the Lazio Region and some hints from the Campania Region, located in Central Italy. Energy Density Potential in Land (EDPL), is calculated for each renewable energy technology (solar, wind, geothermal) highlighting the potentiality of the last.
   Why the Italian case history among the densely populated countries? on the Italian territory is hard to find suitable areas (mostly if greenfields) to use the own underground, with respect to other European countries, due to the presence of seismotectonic activity and many faulted areas characterized by Diffuse Degassing Structures (DDSs, which are rich in CO2 and CH4). In this cases, public acceptance must be facilitated by the concerted efforts of researchers, universities, NGOs and policy-makers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of the turbulent sensible heat, latent heat and carbon dioxide fluxes for 12 months (2011-2012) are reported for the first time for a suburban area in the UK. The results from Swindon are comparable to suburban studies of similar surface cover elsewhere but reveal large seasonal variability. Energy partitioning favours turbulent sensible heat during summer (midday Bowen ratio 1.4-1.6) and latent heat in winter (0.05-0.7). A significant proportion of energy is stored (and released) by the urban fabric and the estimated anthropogenic heat flux is small but non-negligible (0.5-0.9 MJ m(-2) day(-1)). The sensible heat flux is negative at night and for much of winter daytimes, reflecting the suburban nature of the site (44% vegetation) and relatively low built fraction (16%). Latent heat fluxes appear to be water limited during a dry spring in both 2011 and 2012, when the response of the surface to moisture availability can be seen on a daily timescale. Energy and other factors are more relevant controls at other times; at night the wind speed is important. On average, surface conductance follows a smooth, asymmetrical diurnal course peaking at around 6-9 mm s(-1), but values are larger and highly variable in wet conditions. The combination of natural (vegetative) and anthropogenic (emission) processes is most evident in the temporal variation of the carbon flux: significant photosynthetic uptake is seen during summer, whilst traffic and building emissions explain peak release in winter (9.5 g C m(-2) day(-1)). The area is a net source of CO2 annually. Analysis by wind direction highlights the role of urban vegetation in promoting evapotranspiration and offsetting CO2 emissions, especially when contrasted against peak traffic emissions from sectors with more roads. Given the extent of suburban land use, these results have important implications for understanding urban energy, water and carbon dynamics.

AB Thirty percent of the total worldwide energy is consumed by the residential sector, making it a very significant frontier for energy transitions for sustainability. While the Netherlands aims to achieve a remarkable reduction in the energy consumption in residential buildings with policies mainly aiming at new constructions; little attention is being paid to the existing stock, and this existing stock creates inertia against a transition. Although this is a widely accepted issue, the extent of such inertia has not been analyzed explicitly. In that respect, this study is a preliminary study that aims to demonstrate the importance of the existing housing stock, and the inertia it can cause against an energy transition. Besides, policy options such as increasing efficiency standards for new constructions and increasing the turnover rate of the existing stock are evaluated through simulation experiments using the model developed for the Dutch system. The set of experiments discussed in the paper provides a better understanding about this inertia, as well as what needs to be done for achieving significant progress in a residential energy transition.

TI Global warming implications of facade parameters: A life cycle
   assessment of residential buildings in Bahrain
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
LA English

DE Facade parameters; CO2 emissions; Life cycle assessment
ID ENERGY ANALYSIS; CO2 EMISSIONS; SELECTION; CLIMATE
AB On a global scale, the Gulf Corporation Council Countries (GCCC), including Bahrain, are amongst the top countries in terms of carbon dioxide emissions per capita. Building authority in Bahrain has set a target of 40% reduction of electricity consumption and associated CO2 emissions to be achieved by using facade parameters. This work evaluates how the life cycle CO2 emissions of buildings are affected by facade parameters. The main focus is placed on direct and indirect CO2 emissions from three contributors, namely, chemical reactions during production processes (Pco(2)), embodied energy (Eco(2)) and operational energy (OPco(2)). By means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, it has been possible to show that the greatest environmental impact occurs during the operational phase (80-90%). However, embodied CO2 emissions are an important factor that needs to be brought into the systems used for appraisal of projects, and hence into the design decisions made in developing projects. The assessment shows that masonry blocks are responsible for 70-90% of the total CO2 emissions of facade construction, mainly due to their physical characteristics. The highest Pco(2) emissions factors are those of window elements, particularly aluminium frames. However, their contribution of CO2 emissions depends largely on the number and size of windows. Each square metre of glazing is able to increase the total CO2 emissions by almost 30% when compared with the same areas of opaque walls. The use of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) walls reduces the total life cycle CO2 emissions by almost 5.2% when compared with ordinary walls, while the use of thermal insulation with concrete wall reduces CO2 emissions by 1.2%. The outcome of this work offers to the building industry a reliable indicator of the environmental impact of residential facade parameters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is a widespread interest in reducing environmental impacts of all industries and processes to help achieve the targets set in the Climate Change Act of 2008. The use of alternative construction techniques to build the walls of UK housing has the potential to reduce their environmental impact in a range of ways. This includes the reduction of embodied energy as well as operational energy use, the latter through improved thermal performance. A major challenge to be overcome if alternative techniques are to be used is the acceptability to purchasers. The current acceptability of a range of construction techniques and issues that are important to purchasers were examined using a questionnaire. Although the acceptability of lower carbon alternatives is less than that of the conventional technique, findings in this research suggest that there is potential for their use in UK housing. The acceptability of alternative construction techniques varies greatly with type. Concerns expressed about the construction techniques could often be dispelled by existing research, indicating that education is key to improving acceptability of alternative construction techniques and hence opening the way to accessing their environmental benefits. The respondents identified environmental issues, finance, operating costs and risk as key areas of concern, which need to be considered during decision-making. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Of all the potential benefits of urban containment, compaction, and densification, just two are the central focus here: attainment of greater energy efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions. In cities these are largely associated with the transport and building sectors. This paper probes the form-efficiency relation in the transport sector across 57 census-defined urbanized areas in the United States in 2000. Thirty-six of the forty largest are included. Increase in core area population density is correlated with modest gain in energy efficiency in the urban transport sector and modest decrease in its. carbon emissions. Densification's lagged effects related to travel rationalization and growth in transit receptivity may increase overall metro transport energy efficiency beyond the degree revealed here. These impacts are associated with two off-setting negative externalities: (1) diminished housing affordability, and (2) increased roadway congestion. Each may moderate over time. Such effects are non-additive, owing to a difference of metrics. Elevated CAFE standards provoking new transport technologies may reduce total energy consumption and associated emissions ceteris paribus, lessening densification's marginal efficiency payoff while magnifying the significance of densification's opportunity costs. Categories of policy interventions to promote metro-scale energy efficiencies and emissions reductions, with and without urban densification, conclude the paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A potential source of energy savings in buildings is demand controlled ventilation (DCV), or dynamic modulation of the ventilation rate based on current occupancy. The impact of DCV on indoor air quality (IAQ) has not been investigated over a large range of indoor air processes or under the revised ventilation rate procedure (VRP) introduced in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004, which reduced per-occupant rates and added a constant per-area rate. A transient, multi-contaminant model of an area-normalized US office was created, and best estimates for distributions of model inputs across the US office sector were developed and used in a six city Monte Carlo simulation of dynamic ventilation strategies, including DCV and morning flushes. DCV implementation had a very minor effect on concentrations of ozone, particles, and carbon dioxide. The greatest effect was on daytime mean and peak concentration of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC). TVOC daytime means increased by 7-10% and peaks increased by 10-14%, depending on city. Adding a medium intensity morning flush to DCV almost completely mitigated the increase in mean concentration and reduced the peak concentration below the fixed ventilation baseline in most cases. Differences among offices due to input variations were far greater than changes observed from implementing DCV, and a sensitivity analysis indicated that the TVOC emission rate was more influential than the ventilation strategy. The distribution-based, sector-wide Monte Carlo method developed here should also be useful for assessing other ventilation strategies and input parameter impacts and informing the development of IAQ guidelines.

AB Having in mind constantly changing regulatory frameworks which demand both carbon emission reduction and improvement of the quality of internal environment, this paper analyses strengths and limitations of available design tools of various complexity: Annex 36 Energy Concept Advisor Tool and an approved Dynamic Simulation Model. As a platform for discussion, two representative school buildings in North London were selected and modelled using both tools. Discussion integrates views of 76 building industry professionals on applicability of various school retrofit options in practice. Using the available statistics on total number of schools and floor space in each category, a simple extrapolation was applied to roughly quantify potential for carbon emission reduction of the school building stock in England and Wales.

AB Although China became the world's largest CO2 emitter in 2007, the country has also taken serious actions to reduce its energy and carbon intensity. This study uses the bottom-up LBNL China End-Use Energy Model to assess the role of energy efficiency policies in transitioning China to a lower emission trajectory and meeting its 2020 intensity reduction goals. Two scenarios - Continued Improvement and Accelerated Improvement - were developed to assess the impact of actions already taken by the Chinese government as well as planned and potential actions, and to evaluate the potential for China to reduce energy demand and emissions. This scenario analysis presents an important modeling approach based in the diffusion of end-use technologies and physical drivers of energy demand and thereby help illuminate China's complex and dynamic drivers of energy consumption and implications of energy efficiency policies. The findings suggest that China's CO2 emissions will not likely continue growing throughout this century because of saturation effects in appliances, residential and commercial floor area, roadways, fertilizer use; and population peak around 2030 with slowing urban population growth. The scenarios also underscore the significant role that policy-driven efficiency improvements will play in meeting 2020 carbon mitigation goals along with a decarbonized power supply.

AB Globally, buildings are responsible for 40% of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Devising policies for a low carbon city requires a careful understanding of the characteristics of urban residential lifestyle and consumption. The production-based accounting approach based on top-down statistical data has a limited ability to reflect the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from residential consumption. In this paper, we present a survey-based GHG emissions accounting methodology for urban residential consumption, and apply it in Xiamen City, a rapidly urbanizing coastal city in southeast China. Based on this, the main influencing factors determining residential GHG emissions at the household and community scale are identified, and the typical profiles of low, medium and high GHG emission households and communities are identified. Up to 70% of household GHG emissions are from regional and national activities that support household consumption including the supply of energy and building materials, while 17% are from urban level basic services and supplies such as sewage treatment and solid waste management, and only 13% are direct emissions from household consumption. Housing area and household size are the two main factors determining GHG emissions from residential consumption at the household scale, while average housing area and building height were the main factors at the community scale. Our results show a large disparity in GHG emissions profiles among different households, with high GHG emissions households emitting about five times more than low GHG emissions households. Emissions from high GHG emissions communities are about twice as high as from low GHG emissions communities. Our findings can contribute to better tailored and targeted policies aimed at reducing household GHG emissions, and developing low GHG emissions residential communities in China.

AB The present economy is not sustainable with regard to its per capita material consumption. A dematerialization of the economy of industrialized countries can be achieved by a change in course, from an industrial economy built on throughput to a circular economy built on stock optimization, decoupling wealth and welfare from resource consumption while creating more work. The business models of a circular economy have been known since the mid-1970s and are now applied in a number of industrial sectors. This paper argues that a simple and convincing lever could accelerate the shift to a circular economy, and that this lever is the shift to a tax system based on the principles of sustainability: not taxing renewable resources including human labour-work-but taxing non-renewable resources instead is a powerful lever. Taxing materials and energies will promote low-carbon and low-resource solutions and a move towards a 'circular' regional economy as opposed to the 'linear' global economy requiring fuel-based transport for goods throughput. In addition to substantial improvements in material and energy efficiency, regional job creation and national greenhouse gas emission reductions, such a change will foster all activities based on 'caring', such as maintaining cultural heritage and natural wealth, health services, knowledge and know-how.

ID CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENCY; SECTOR
AB This paper provides an analysis of the current energy usage (net energy and final energy by fuels) and associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the Swedish residential building stock, which includes single-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings. Twelve energy saving measures (ESMs) are assessed using a bottom-up modeling methodology, in which the Swedish residential stock is represented by a sample of 1400 buildings (based on data from the year 2005). Application of the ESMs studied gives a maximum technical reduction potential in energy demand of 53%, corresponding to a 63% reduction in CO2 emissions. Although application of the investigated ESMs would reduce CO2 emissions, the measures that reduce electricity consumption for lighting and appliances (LA) will increase CO2 emissions, since the saved electricity production is less CO2-intensive than the fuel mix used for the increased space heating required to make up for the loss in indirect heating obtained from LA.

AB Urban population now exceeds rural population globally, and 60-80% of global energy consumption by households, businesses, transportation, and industry occurs in urban areas. There is growing evidence that built-up infrastructure contributes to carbon emissions inertia, and that investments in infrastructure today have delayed climate cost in the future. Although the United Nations statistics include data on urban population by country and select urban agglomerations, there are no empirical data on built-up infrastructure for a large sample of cities. Here we present the first study to examine changes in the structure of the world's largest cities from 1999 to 2009. Combining data from two space-borne sensors-backscatter power (PR) from NASA's SeaWinds microwave scatterometer, and nighttime lights (NL) from NOAA's defense meteorological satellite program/operational linescan system (DMSP/OLS)-we report large increases in built-up infrastructure stock worldwide and show that cities are expanding both outward and upward. Our results reveal previously undocumented recent and rapid changes in urban areas worldwide that reflect pronounced shifts in the form and structure of cities. Increases in built-up infrastructure are highest in East Asian cities, with Chinese cities rapidly expanding their material infrastructure stock in both height and extent. In contrast, Indian cities are primarily building out and not increasing in verticality. This new dataset will help characterize the structure and form of cities, and ultimately improve our understanding of how cities affect regional-to-global energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Integrated solar absorption cooling and heating (SACH) systems, which use solar energy to provide space heating, space cooling, and water heating, represent a promising substitute to reduce the earth's carbon emissions. SACH systems currently are designed based on engineering experience for the most part and few systematic methodologies are available to identify the key optimal parameters for SACH systems, such as the slope of the solar collectors, the area of the solar collectors, and the volume of the storage tanks. As a result, the established systems usually are not capable of yielding the greatest returns on investment. Motivated by the above facts, this study investigates a formal method for SACH system optimization by incorporating simultaneously a system's performance related to its economic, energy, and environmental aspects. The proposed method includes central composite design, regression, and multi-objective optimization. Central composite design (CCD) is used to select the significant experimental data generated by energy system simulation and life cycle analysis. Linear regression models are used to predict the functional relationship between system performance and the key system parameters using data sets. A multi-objective optimization model is then formulated and solved based on the Weighted-Tchebycheff metric approach. The proposed approach is applied to medium-sized office buildings located in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago; and the results suggest that the approach can provide a systematic mechanism to optimally design SACH systems.

AB The Energy Information Administration of the United States Department of Energy projects that more than 80% of the energy consumption of the U. S. by 2035 will come from fossil fuels. This projection should be the fuel to promote projects related to renewable energy in order to reduce energy consumption from fossil fuels to avoid their undesirable consequences such as carbon dioxide emissions. Since solar radiation match pretty well building cooling demands, solar cooling systems will be an important factor in the next decades to meet or exceed the green gases reduction that will be demanded by the society and regulations in order to mitigate environmental consequences such as global warming. Solar energy can be used as source of energy to produce cooling through different technologies. Solar thermal energy applies to technology such as absorption chillers and desiccant cooling, while electricity from solar photovoltaic can be used to drive vapor compression electric chillers. This study focuses on the comparison of a solar thermal cooling system that uses an absorption chiller driven by solar thermal energy, and a solar photovoltaic cooling system that uses a vapor compression system (electric chiller) driven by solar electricity (solar photovoltaic system). Both solar cooling systems are compared against a standard air cooled cooling system that uses electricity from the grid. The models used in the simulations to obtain the results are described in the paper along with the parameters (inputs) used. Results are presented in two figures. Each figure has one curve for the solar thermal cooling system and one for the solar photovoltaic cooling system. One figure allows estimation of savings calculated based the present value of discounted energy consumption cost. The other figure allows estimating primary energy consumption reduction and emissions reduction. Both figures presents the result per ton of refrigeration and as a function of area of solar collectors or/and area of photovoltaic modules. This approach to present the result of the simulations of the systems makes these figures quite general. This means that the results can be used to compare both solar cooling systems independently of the cooling demand (capacity of the system), as well as allow the analysis for different sizes of the solar system used to harvest the solar energy (collectors or photovoltaic modules).

AB Rehabilitation of the existing building stock is a key measure for reaching the proposed reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in all countries. Building Information Models stand as an optimal solution for works management and decision-making assessment, due to their capacity to coordinate all the information needed for the diagnosis of the building and the planning of the rehabilitation works. If these models are generated from laser scanning point clouds automatically textured with thermographic and RGB images, their capacities are exponentially increased, since also their visualization and not only the consultation of their data increases the information available from the building. Since laser scanning, infrared thermography and photography are techniques that acquire information of the object as-is, the resulting BIM includes information on the real condition of the building in the moment of inspection, consequently helping to a more efficient planning of the rehabilitation works, enabling the repair of the most severe faults. This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic generation of textured as-built models, starting with data acquisition and continuing with geometric and thermographic data processing.

ID UK HOUSING STOCK; EMISSIONS
AB This paper presents the development and evaluation of the Belgrade Domestic Energy Model (BEDEM) for predicting the energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the existing housing stock. The distribution of energy use in relation to the end use is estimated as: space heating, 71%; light and appliances, 15%; water heating, 9%; and cooking 5%, while the distribution of CO2 emissions is space heating, 59%; light and appliances, 22%; water heating, 13%; and cooking 6%. Local sensitivity analysis is carried out for dwellings of different type and year built, and the largest normalized sensitivity coefficients were calculated for parameters which almost exclusively influence space heating energy consumption in housing. For all input parameters under investigation, the effects of the input uncertainty were linear for a moderate range of input change (Delta x=+/- 10%) and superposable for a small range of input change (Delta x=+/- 1%). However, the non-linear and non-additive properties of some input parameters over the wider range hinder the development of a simple but reliable model for estimating energy and CO2 reductions. The findings show that the uncertainty in the stock models predictions can be large and more work is needed in the area of the predictive uncertainty of stock models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the average wood products usage per unit of floor area in Australia has decreased significantly over time, there is potential for increased greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits through an increased use of wood products in buildings. This study determined the GHG outcomes of the extraction, manufacture, transport, use in construction, maintenance and disposal of wood products and other building materials for two popular house designs in Sydney, Australia.
   The life cycle assessment (LCA) was undertaken using the computer model SimaPro 7.1, with the functional unit being the supply of base building elements for domestic houses in Sydney and its subsequent use over a 50-year period. The key data libraries used were the Australian Life Cycle Inventory library, the ecoinvent library (with data adapted to Australian circumstances where appropriate) and data for timber production from an Australian study for a range of Australian forestry production systems and wood products. Two construction variations were assessed: the original intended construction, and a "timber-maximised" alternative. The indicator assessed was global warming, as the focus was on GHG emissions, and the effect of timber production, use and disposal on the fate of carbon.
   The timber maximised design resulted in approximately half the GHG emissions associated with the base designs. The sub-floor had the largest greenhouse impact due to the concrete components, followed by the walls due to the usage of bricks. The use of a "timber maximised" design offset between 23 and 25 % of the total operational energy of the houses. Inclusion of carbon storage in landfill made a very significant difference to GHG outcomes, equivalent to 40-60 % of total house GHG emissions. The most beneficial options for disposal from a GHG perspective were landfill and incineration with energy recovery.
   The study showed that significant GHG emission savings were achieved by optimising the use of wood products for two common house designs in Sydney. The switch of the sub-floor and floor covering components to a "wood" option accounted for most of the GHG savings. Inclusion of end of life parameters significantly impacted on the outcomes of the study.

AB Given the rising expectations for the substitution of fossil energy with renewable energy as one of the solutions to cope with climate change, the carbon emission reduction potential of possible solutions should be evaluated in a holistic and systematic way. In this paper, a systematic account of carbon emission reduction potential was conducted for a typical household biogas system with a digester volume of 8 m(3), using a hybrid life-cycle assessment method. Using a 20 year operation scenario, the total life cycle CO2 emission of this family-size biogas utilization system is 2.60 tons, i.e., 0.02 kg CO2/MJ, of which 98.46% is attributed to indirect emissions from building materials and labor inputs. Considering the carbon emission savings due to energy and fertilizer substitution, the annual CO2 emission reduction potential is 1.25 tons for the biogas system that is under consideration. Consequently, such rural household biogas systems should be operated for at least 1.78 years to achieve a positive reduction benefit, i.e., cumulative CO2 emission savings could offset the life-cycle-related CO2 emissions. The results also indicate that long-term, stable running and maintenance are key points to maximize the benefits of household biogas as an effective approach for carbon emission abatement in the rural areas of China.

AB This work is a part of a wider study involving the economic and environmental implications of managing construction and demolition waste (CDW), focused on the operation of a large scale CDW recycling plant. This plant, to be operated in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (including the Setubal peninsula), is analysed for a 60 year period, using primary energy consumption and CO(2)eq emission impact factors as environmental impact performance indicators.
   Simplified estimation methods are used to calculate industrial equipment incorporated, and the operation and transport related impacts. Material recycling - sorted materials sent to other industries, to act as input - is taken into account by discounting the impacts related to industrial processes no longer needed.
   This first part focuses on calculating the selected impact factors for a base case scenario (with a 350 tonnes/h installed capacity), while a sensitivity analysis is provided in part two. Overall, a 60 year global primary energy consumption of 71.4 thousand toe (tonne of oil equivalent) and a total CO(2)eq emission of 135.4 thousand tonnes are expected. Under this operating regime, around 563 thousand toe and 1465 thousand tonnes CO(2)eq could be prevented by replacing raw materials in several construction materials industries (e.g.: ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics, paper and cardboard).

AB This paper makes a case for building syngas networks as a means of contributing to the reduction of industrial carbon footprints. After exploring historic and conventional approaches to producing syngas (or synthesis gas) from fossil fuels on increasingly large scales, the paper looks at ways of producing it from renewable sources and from surplus resource (or waste) from industrial, domestic, urban and agricultural systems. The many ways of converting syngas into power, industrial heat, fuels, chemical feedstocks and chemical products are then outlined along with the associated syngas purification requirements. Some of the processes involved provide an opportunity for cost-effective capture and storage of CO2. Pathways through this range of possibilities that enable a net reduction in energy footprint or in CO2 emissions are identified and exemplified. Recognising that those opportunities are likely to involve industrial facilities that are distributed spatially within a geographic area, the case for building an interconnecting syngas network is explored. Issues surrounding sizing the network, timing its growth, determining ownership and access arrangements, and planning/regulatory hurdles are found to be similar to the analogous case of building an industrial CO2 network, with the added complication that the term "syngas" tends to be used to cover a fairly wide range of gas compositions.

ID UNIVERSITY
AB Increasingly, institutions are reporting greenhouse gas emissions as a means to measure sustainability. One way higher education is taking a leadership role is through the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), which requires signatory institutions to account for their emissions and develop a climate action plan with emissions reduction goals. Recent data for 135 colleges and universities reporting greenhouse gas emissions was characterized and analyzed. Greenhouse gas emissions from these institutions were found to be a function of the size of the institution (as measured by full-time student enrollment and building area), the amount of laboratory and residential space, whether there is a medical school, and the extent of commuting to campus by faculty, staff and students. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are primarily influenced by the physical size of the institution and secondarily by climate. When looking at gross (total scope 1, 2 and 3) emissions, laboratory space was found to have 10 times more effect on emissions per square meter than space such as classroom and office, while residential space had a two-fold effect. These results change somewhat when looking at smaller schools that have gross emissions of 50,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent or less. These results have implications for institutions of higher education at the policy level in that those institutions that are more laboratory intense and face greater challenges in reducing their GHG footprint. Residential colleges and universities also experience a disproportionate impact on their emissions, probably as a result of the 24 h, 7-day a week demands of such campuses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper a multi-objective optimization model is developed to determine the best size of grid independent solar-diesel-battery based hybrid energy system. The primary objective is to minimize life cycle cost and secondary objective is to minimize CO2 emissions from the system. These objective functions are subjected to the constraints imposed by the power generated by the system components, reliability of the system and state of charge of the battery bank. The decision variables included in the optimization process are the total area of PV arrays, number of PV modules of 600 W-p, number of batteries of 24 V and 150 Ah, diesel generator power and fuel consumption per year. A computer program is build up in C programming language to determine the specifications of hybrid system components. The proposed method has been applied to an un-electrified remote village in Moradabad district of Uttar Pradesh, India. Results shows that the optimal configuration of an autonomous system is PV area of 300 m(2), 60 PV modules of 600 W-p, 160 batteries of 24 V. and 150 Ah and a diesel generator power of 5 kW. This system involves PV penetration of 86% and a diesel fraction of 14% having LCC of $110,546 for 25 years, fuel consumption of 1150 1/year and CO2 emissions of 0.019 tCO(2)/capita/year.

AB We adopted the simple average Divisia index approach to explore the impacts of factors on the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road freight transportation in China from 1985 to 2007. CO2 emissions were investigated using the following as influencing factors: the emission coefficient, vehicle fuel intensity, working vehicle stock per freight transport operator, market concentration level, freight transportation distance, market share of road freight transportation, ton-kilometer per value added of industry, industrialization level and economic growth. Building on the results, we suggest that economic growth is the most important factor in increasing CO2 emissions, whereas the ton-kilometer per value added of industry and the market concentration level contribute significantly to decreasing CO2 emissions. We also discussed some recent important policies concerning factors contained in the decomposition model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present paper is focused on the optimization of combined heat and power distributed generation systems. In particular, the authors describe a mixed-integer linear programming model that has been developed in order to optimally design and operate an energy system in a limited urban area where buildings are equipped with small-size CHP plants and are connected by a heat distribution network; in the proposed model a multi-objective function is optimized, since capital and operating costs, as well as CO2 emissions, are taken into account. The model has a general validity even if the results reported in the present paper are relative to the case study represented by a residential and tertiary district in the city of Arenzano in the North of Italy. Furthermore, a comparative study has been done in order to quantify the benefits, in terms of economic saving and CO2 emission reduction, of having a combined heat and power distributed generation system in buildings in spite of using boilers to produce heat and of buying electricity from the grid.

   urban sustainability

ID INDIVIDUAL DISCOUNT RATES; PURCHASE; POLICIES; MARKET
AB US cities are beginning to experiment with a regulatory approach to address information failures in the real estate market by mandating the energy benchmarking of commercial buildings. Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly.

TI Embodied CO2 emissions in the building - where are they
   mainly located? Two different virtual perspectives on the LCA analysis
   of the construction methods and components of four different apartment
   buildings
SO BAUINGENIEUR
LA German
DT Article
AB A set of four buildings, consisting of different types of construction, is being analysed in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The aim of this study is to address one essential challenge in LCAs of buildings, namely the presentation of the LCA results in a way that clearly provides valuable information for the architect, with regard to which building elements are the main contributors to the overall embodied carbon emissions of a building over its entire lifetime. The results are presented by virtually "cutting" the buildings in two different ways, focusing not only on the building as a whole, incorporating all its various materials, but also on the individual impact of each building element (floor, ceilings, external walls, etc.) on the one hand, and on the impact of a predefined standard enclosed floor space (e.g. basement space, typical floor space, roof space) on the other. The first virtual cutting approach aims at breaking down the total kg CO(2)eq of each building to the functional unit of 1 m(2) of general floor space (in this case the energy reference area) for 1 year of the building's lifetime. This functional unit is commonly utilized for LCAs of buildings and facilitates a general comparison of the four apartment buildings by levelling out the differences in building sizes. It is, however, not the best way of showing clearly where exactly the main contributors to the final result are situated within the building. When looking at a building from an architect's point of view, there is no such thing as a general 1 m(2) of floor space to which the overall building emission results could be meaningfully allocated. Instead, each storey has its individual contributors to the final result. The floor element, for instance, only contributes to the lowest building storey, while the roof element normally only covers the top storey. In contrast, the external and internal walls are found on all storeys. Therefore, the second approach aims at systematically defining four typical storeys within a building (basement, ground floor, upper floor and loft) by their specific characteristics. The carbon emissions are then calculated for 1 m(2) of this specific floor space and 1 year of the building's lifetime. The objective of this second approach is to clarify the interrelations of the different individual parts of the buildings within their overall functional context, while at the same time allowing for a meaningful presentation and interpretation of their respective impacts with regard to embodied carbon emissions. Different perspectives and levels of detail are covered in the critical impact evaluation of each building, giving a thorough and comprehensible answer to the question of where its embodied CO2 is primarily located. While the first functional unit can be used in order to get a broad view of the embodied carbon emissions of the various building elements of the whole building, the second functional unit facilitates a more sophisticated allocation of the results, with regard to the anticipated location of the most relevant elements per storey. It can be observed that the second virtual cutting approach shows fewer individual differences and a more generic distribution of the carbon emission results of the four buildings compared with the results of the first cutting approach. Furthermore, using the second approach, the embodied emissions of an average square metre of basement, ground floor, upper floor and loft with a minimum and maximum deviation from the mean value can be determined.
   As the buildings within the depicted set exhibit a high level of variety with regard to their construction types and the embodied carbon emissions of their individual building elements, the rather high degree of homogeneity of the results as displayed by the second virtual cutting approach is especially remarkable. It was demonstrated that by schematically cutting the buildings on the basis of only a few simple conceptual assumptions about the specifications of each storey, a consistent comparison of a set of diverse buildings is feasible, and that quite similar results can be generated from the direct comparison of the same storey of the various buildings. Furthermore, determining the impact of a standard storey of basement, ground floor, upper floor and loft can help architects and planners to quickly evaluate the performance of their building. design by using these values as benchmarks, enabling them to localize which storey and which building elements bear the highest optimization potential for their specific project.

AB In this study, the possibilities to decrease energy consumption of a residential building in Serbian conditions are analyzed. The building uses electricity for space heating system, heating of domestic hot water, lighting, and for other electric equipment. The electrical energy is generated by photovoltaics (PV) system and it may be consumed by the building or may be fed-in to the electricity grid. The major aim of the optimization of PV area is to determine the avoided electricity from the grid (avoided exergy), and to minimize the consumption of primary energy. The residential buildings with variable thermal insulation thickness, hot water consumption, life time, and PV's embodied energy are investigated, in order to achieve zero-net energy building or positive-net energy building. The buildings are presented by a mathematical model, in EnergyPlus environment. Open Studio plug-in in Google SketchUp was used for building virtual design, Hooke-Jeeves algorithm for optimization, and GENOPT software for software execution control. For the different areas of photovoltaics, the investigations gave the results for their optimal values. In that way, the fossil energy consumption and CO2 emission are also minimized.

AB Climate change has a dual implication on the built environment: on one hand human settlements and buildings are vulnerable to the effects of changing climate and on the other hand the building sector has a significant climate change mitigation potential. The relevant sustainable development and building policies as well as the building design, construction and maintenance strategies should jointly respond both to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.
   What should city developers focus on in order to plan a sustainable and safe city in a changing climate? This paper provides answers to this question, presenting a bottom-up methodology based on a generalized building typology of the residential building stock in order to estimate the mitigation potential and vulnerability of the residential sector.
   During the research, a case study has been implemented in Hungary to assess the structural impacts and vulnerability on the roof, particularly with respect to the wind load and to estimate the potential decrease of CO2 emission through refurbishment. Through the case study the paper highlights the most problematic areas of the city both from vulnerability and mitigation point of view where the attention of the city developers should be turned.

   Thermal comfort; Future climate scenarios; Overheating
AB Half of humanity now lives in cities and the cities of the world continue to expand. However, inappropriate design of buildings combined with heat island conditions in dense urban areas and the effects of climate change may result in unsuitable accommodation, which is inherently unsustainable.
   An underlying problem in the long term housing supply has led to demand not being met for many years. The British government therefore announced that it is committed to increase the rate of house-building and support the use of Modern Methods of Construction as a possible solution. Simultaneously, in an attempt to tackle climate change, an ambitious target has been set for all new houses to meet net zero carbon dioxide emissions from 2016.
   The Mark Group Research House, a super insulated steel frame home, was designed to test MMC solutions and innovative technologies, and to achieve 'zero carbon' without compromising user's comfort. A computer model was used to investigate the house's potential for overheating in today's weather as well as in future climate scenarios. The simulations have found that generally the house is comfortable but, despite the addition of mitigating strategies, there is a risk of overheating which is aggravated in future scenarios.

TI Impact of urban residences on energy consumption and carbon emissions:
   An investigation in Nanjing, China
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Energy consumption; Carbon emissions; Nanjing
AB This paper analysed the energy consumption of urban households in Nanjing and the influencing factors in this energy consumption. The households studied were located in three urban districts of Nanjing: the city centre, a spontaneous residential area around the old city, and a planned satellite town. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on building characteristics, household characteristics, use of domestic appliances, and fuel oil consumption. Energy use was analysed by conversion into CO2 emissions. The study found that household use and transport were the two main contributors to domestic energy consumption. Household electricity consumption showed obvious seasonal characteristics (higher in summer than in other seasons), while transport energy consumption showed geographical characteristics (the old town had lowest transport energy consumption). Highly efficient devices may not render buildings more energy-efficient, so architects should seek to reduce the need for such devices. Energy consumption and income were generally positively correlated. Family structure also influenced energy consumption, with high-income families and small families consuming more energy per capita. Economic and social factors were found to be equally important to technical factors for energy efficiency. Based on the findings, some possible policies are recommended. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Life Cycle Energy Analyses of buildings provide useful information for achieving sustainability. However, care must be taken when interpreting previous studies because of different life cycle stages included, Other problems found include the use of different types of areas and quality of data. This paper presents an audited database of Life Cycle Energy Analyses of buildings. A Literature Based Discovery method has been adopted to analyze 38 research works consisting of 206 cases. The average initial embodied energy for offices is found to be 10.47 GJ/m(2) and that of residential property is 4.10 GJ/m(2). When the initial embodied energy is expressed as number of years of heating and cooling energy, the range is very wide. However, when it is expressed as number of years of operational energy, the results are consistent (7.8 years for offices and 7.5 years for residential buildings). It is expected that the audited information on the energy requirement of buildings will provide valuable information for designers and decision makers. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As the world urbanizes, the role of cities in determining sustainability outcomes grows in importance. Cities are the dominant form of human habitat, and most of the world's resources are either directly or indirectly consumed in cities. Sustainable city analysis and management requires understanding the demands a city places on a wider geographical area and its ecological resource base. We present a detailed, integrated urban metabolism of residential consumption and ecological footprint analysis of the Vancouver metropolitan region for the year 2006. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the application of a bottom-up ecological footprint analysis using an urban metabolism framework at a metropolitan, regional scale. Our specific objectives are: a) to quantify energy and material consumption using locally generated data and b) to relate these data to global ecological carrying capacity. Although water is the largest material flow through Metro Vancouver (424,860,000 m(3)), it has the smallest ecological footprint (23,100 gha). Food (2,636,850 tonnes) contributes the largest component to the ecological footprint (4,514,400 gha) which includes crop and grazing land as well as carbon sinks required to sequester emissions from food production and distribution. Transportation fuels (3,339,000 m(3)) associated with motor vehicle operation and passenger air travel comprises the second largest material flow through the region and the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (7,577,000 tonnes). Transportation also accounts for the second largest component of the EF (2,323,200 gha). Buildings account for the largest electricity flow (17,515,150 MWh) and constitute the third largest component of the EF (1,779,240 gha). Consumables (2,400,000 tonnes) comprise the fourth largest component of the EF (1,414,440 gha). Metro Vancouver's total Ecological Footprint in 2006 was 10,071,670 gha, an area approximately 36 times larger than the region itself. The EFA reveals that cropland and carbon sinks (forested land required to sequester carbon dioxide emissions) account for 90% of Metro Vancouver's overall demand for biocapacity. The per capita ecological footprint is 4.76 gha, nearly three times the per capita global supply of biocapacity. Note that this value excludes national government services that operate outside the region and could account for up to an additional 2 gha/ca. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global energy efficiency can be obtained in two ordinary ways. One way is to improve the energy production and supply side, and the other way is, in general, to reduce the consumption of energy in society. This paper has focus on the latter and especially the consumption of energy for heating and cooling our houses. There is a huge energy-saving potential in this area for reducing both the global climate problems as well as economy challenges. Heating of buildings in Denmark accounts for approximately 40% of the entire national energy consumption. For this reason, a reduction of heat losses from building envelopes are of great importance in order to reach the Bologna CO2 emission reduction targets. Upgrading of the energy performance of buildings is a topic of huge global interest these years. Not only heating in the temperate and arctic regions are important, but also air conditioning and mechanical ventilation in the "warm countries" contribute to an enormous energy consumption and corresponding CO2 emission. In order to establish the best basis for upgrading the energy performance, it is important to make measurements of the heat losses at different places on a building facade, in order to optimize the energy performance. This paper presents a method for measuring the heat loss by utilizing a U-value meter. The U-value meter measures the heat transfer in the unit W/Km(2) and has been used in several projects to upgrade the energy performance in temperate regions. The U-value meter was also utilized in an EUDP (Energy Technological Development and Demonstration Program) focusing on renovation of houses from the 1960s and 1970s.

AB Residential buildings account for about one-third of the final energy demand in Norway. Many cost-effective measures for reducing heat losses in buildings are known, and their implementation may make the building sector one of the largest contributors to climate change mitigation. To determine the sectoral emission reduction potential, we model a complete transformation of the dwelling stock by 2050 by applying both renovation and reconstruction with different energy standards. We propose a new dynamic stock model with an optimization routine to identify and prioritize buildings with the highest energy saving potential. We combine material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques to extend the sectoral boundary beyond direct household emissions. Despite an expected population growth of almost 50% between 2000 and 2050, sectoral carbon emissions in that period may drop between 30% and 40% for scenarios where the stock is completely transformed by either reconstruction or renovation to the passive house standard. Due to its lower upstream impact, renovation leads to a lower sectoral carbon footprint than reconstruction. Full transformation, however, is not sufficient to achieve an emissions reduction of 50% or more, as required on average to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, because hot water generation, appliances, and lighting will dominate the sectoral footprint once the stock has been transformed. A first estimate of the additional impact of realistic energy efficiency and lifestyle changes in the nonheating part of the sector reveals a maximal total reduction potential of about 75%.

AB Presented in this paper is a detailed embodied energy consumption evaluation framework for building construction engineering. The building construction engineering comprises nine sub-projects, which are Structure and outside decoration engineering, Primary decoration engineering, Electrical engineering, Water supply and drainage engineering, HVAC engineering, Civil engineering, Municipal electrical engineering, Municipal water supply and drainage engineering and Gardening engineering. Our study chooses the construction engineering of a cluster of landmark commercial buildings in E-town, Beijing (Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, BDA) as a case. As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to account the embodied energy consumption for building construction engineering based on the most exhaustive first-hand project data with about 1000 input items in the Bill of Quantities (BOQ). The embodied energy consumption of construction engineering is quantified as 7.15E+14J. Structure and outside decoration engineering contributes more than half of the total embodied energy consumption, followed by Primary decoration engineering's 23% and Electrical engineering's 3%, respectively. As for the input items, the sum of the embodied energy consumption by steel, cement, lime and metal products is more than 3/4 of the total embodied energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The leakage of cold, methane-rich fluids from subsurface reservoirs to the sea floor at specific sites on continental slopes, termed cold seeps, sustains some of the richest ecosystems on the sea bed. These seep-fuelled communities utilize around two orders of magnitude more oxygen per unit area than non-seep seafloor communities. Much of the oxygen is consumed by microbes and animal-microbe symbioses that use methane as an energy source. The proportion of methane consumed varies with fluid flow rate, ranging from 80% in seeps with slow fluid flow to less than 20% in seeps where fluid flow is high. Assuming the presence of a few tens of thousands of active cold seep systems on continental slopes worldwide, we estimate that the total efflux of methane to the overlying ocean could reach 0.02 Gt of carbon annually. As much more methane is lost from continental slopes, be it through emission to the hydrosphere or consumption by microbes, than can be produced, we suggest that a substantial fraction of the methane that fuels seep ecosystems is sourced from deep carbon buried kilometres under the sea floor.

AB Cities occupy 2% of the earth's surface but their inhabitants consume 75% of the world's energy resources. Under certain conditions, the heat from solar radiation and different urban activities can make city temperatures rise in certain areas, simply because of the way in which a city is structured. This effect is known as the urban heat island (UHI). This article provides a review of recent research on the urban heat island as well as of the strategies that can be applied to mitigate its adverse effects. Such strategies can be applied in the project design phase of urban planning and thus directly affect city temperatures on a local scale. The elements analyzed in this paper include green spaces, trees, albedo, pavement surfaces, vegetation, as well as building types and materials. The discussion of this research clearly reflects the impact of urban morphology on local temperatures and how urban design can be modified to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. This study is useful for professionals who are responsible for decision-making during the design phase of urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Solar City Indicator: A methodology to predict city level PV installed
   capacity by combining physical capacity and socio-economic factors

AB Shifting to renewable sources of electricity is imperative in achieving global reductions in carbon emissions and ensuring future energy security. One technology, solar photovoltaics (PV), has begun to generate a noticeable contribution to the electricity mix in numerous countries. However, the upper limits of this contribution have not been explored in a way that combines both building-by-building solar resource appraisals with the city-scale socio-economic contexts that dictate PV uptake. This paper presents such a method, whereby a 'Solar City Indicator' is calculated and used to rank cities by their capacity to generate electricity from roof-mounted PV. Seven major UK cities were chosen for analysis based on available data; Dundee, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The physical capacity of each city was established using a GIS-based methodology, exploiting digital surface models and LiDAR data, with distinct methodologies for large and small properties. Socio-economic factors (income, education, environmental consciousness, building stock and ownership) were chosen based on existing literature and correlation with current levels of PV installations. These factors were enumerated using data that was readily available across each city. Results show that Derby has the greatest potential of all the cities analysed, as it offers both good physical and socio-economic potential. In terms of physical capacity it was seen that over a 15 year payback period there are two plateaus, showing a marked difference in viability between small and large PV arrays. It was found that both the physical and socio-economic potential of a city are strongly influenced by the nature of the local building stock. This study also identifies areas where policy needs to be focused in order to encourage uptake and highlights factors limiting maximum PV uptake. While this methodology has been demonstrated using UK cities, it is equally applicable to any country where city data is available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HEAT-PUMP SYSTEM; CHALK AQUIFER; TEMPERATURE; LONDON
AB As part of its legal commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, the UK has outlined a roadmap for significant increases in the use of ground source heat pumps for heating and cooling buildings. The technology is particularly suitable in new buildings, and in large commercial buildings. Such development is focussed in urban areas of economic growth. This paper presents an aquifer scale model of the impact of the expansion of open loop ground source energy schemes deployed in London. The model predicts the impact for currently operating schemes, and also the potential impact of all open loop schemes that have been licensed in central London. It is concluded that there will be thermal interference between these schemes and that in areas with such a high density of ground source energy schemes, the resulting loss of efficiency will mark an effective limit to the energy available for unbalanced ground source cooling. The current unregulated approach to managing the energy resource of the Chalk aquifer beneath London will not be able to sustain the demands implied by the UK roadmap for ground source energy. A more actively managed approach is needed if these energy demands are to be met, economically, in London and other centres of economic growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article

AB Agricultural lands have been identified to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions primarily by production of energy crops and substituting fossil energy resources and through carbon sequestration in soils. Increased fertilizer input resulting in increased yields may reduce the area needed for crop production. The surplus area could be used for energy production without affecting the land use necessary for food and feed production. We built a model to investigate the effect of changing nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates on cropping area required for a given amount of crops. We found that an increase in nitrogen fertilizer supply is only justified if GHG mitigation with additional land is higher than 9-15 t carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare (CO2-eq.(.)/ha). The mitigation potential of bioenergy production from energy crops is most often not in this range. Hence, from a GHG abatement point of view land should rather be used to produce crops at moderate fertilizer rate than to produce energy crops. This may change if farmers are forced to reduce their N input due to taxes or governmental regulations as it is the case in Denmark. However, with a fertilizer rate 10 % below the economical optimum a reduction of N input is still more effective than the production of bioenergy unless mitigation effect of the bioenergy production exceeds 7 t carbon dioxide (CO2)-eq.(.)/ha. An intensification of land use in terms of N supply to provide more land for bioenergy production can only in exceptional cases be justified to mitigate GHG emissions with bioenergy under current frame conditions in Germany and Denmark.

AB The significance of retrofitting the existing housing stock is considered for the policy commitment of delivering an 80% CO2 emission reduction by 2050. Background issues of energy, legislation, potential and actual CO2 savings, socioeconomics (payback, fuel poverty, health impacts, employment stimulus, etc.) are discussed. Different potential retrofit strategies for the housing stock are presented. Three large-scale housing retrofit programmes in Wales, UK, are analysed for energy savings (using the Energy and Environmental Prediction Model), CO2 reduction and costs. Two 'whole house' retrofit projects in Wales are also assessed, one of which has been the subject of long-term monitoring. Data are compared on a range of retrofit options: different strategies (elemental, multiple and whole-house measures), costs, actual CO2 reductions and associated benefits. The findings indicate that as the cost of measures rise in relation to the predicted savings, reasonable paybacks will be difficult to achieve, particularly for finance packages such as the 'Green Deal'. There are funding opportunities for installing 'shallow' elemental measures to reduce CO2 emissions by 10-30%. However, the large-scale financing of 'deep' (60-80% reductions) whole-house packages of measures is not currently available and does not pay back.

ID BUILDINGS; ENERGY; STOCK
AB Although a wide range of technical solutions exist to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, these may not produce the predicted savings if occupants operate the refurbished dwelling in unexpected ways, resulting in a performance gap'. Retrofit can be approached as a set of socio-technical issues. Social practice theory is the dominant approach in socio-technical studies of energy in the home. However, other ways can investigate how people engage with and experience their home environments, including their interaction with energy technologies. This can extend the reach of socio-technical studies to encompass personal experience of reconfigured homes within the broader socio-cultural context. Methodologies from phenomenology and ecological psychology used in architecture and philosophy of technology - principally the concepts of breakdown' and affordance - can examine occupants' experience of a retrofitted environment. An energy retrofit of an occupied dwelling is used to illustrate how such methods can provide insights into occupants' experience of and responses to refurbishment. It is suggested that householders' energy and comfort concerns emerge and recede alongside other concerns in both time and space as they adjust to their reconfigured home. Changing affordances after retrofit can influence how people use dwelling space in ways that have energy consumption consequences.

AB Identifying strategies for reconciling human development and climate change mitigation requires an adequate understanding of how infrastructures contribute to well-being and greenhouse gas emissions. While direct emissions from infrastructure use are well-known, information about indirect emissions from their construction is highly fragmented. Here, we estimated the carbon footprint of the existing global infrastructure stock in 2008, assuming current technologies, to be 122 (-20/+15) Gt CO2. The average per-capita carbon footprint of infrastructures in industrialized countries (53 (+/- 6) t CO2) was approximately 5 times larger that that of developing countries (10 (+/- 1) t CO2). A globalization of Western infrastructure stocks using current technologies would cause approximately 350 Gt CO2 from materials production, which corresponds to about 35-60% of the remaining carbon budget available until 2050 if the average temperature increase is to be limited to 2 degrees C, and could thus compromise the 2 degrees C target. A promising but poorly explored mitigation option is to build new settlements using less emissions-intensive materials, for example by urban design; however, this strategy is constrained by a lack of bottom-up data on material stocks in infrastructures. Infrastructure development must be considered in post-Kyoto climate change agreements if developing countries are to participate on a fair basis.

ID URBAN; METHODOLOGY
AB Owners and municipalities face the choice to renovate or rebuild buildings in order to improve energy efficiency and sustainability. The process of upgrading the existing building stock can be supported by land management tools, i.e., municipal energy plans (MEP) or sustainable building codes (BC), that municipalities use to plan, check and monitor actions taken. Many local and regional authorities are involved in the Covenant of Mayors supported by the European Union (EU): the sustainable energy action plan (SEAP) is the key document in which the Covenant signatory outlines how it intends to reach CO2 reduction target by 2020. Sustainability at the urban scale is also supported by voluntary certification schemes such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)(R) for neighbourhood development proposed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) Communities proposed by UK Building Research Establishment (BRE) and Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) for Urban Development proposed by the Japan GreenBuild Council. The fact that there are so many tools to manage urban sustainability is positive, but what happens when multiple tools are applied to the same territory? Overlap, redundancy, and conflicts in management may be critical elements. The purpose of this article is to analyze these critical issues, highlighting the elements of integration and possible synergies for effective management of sustainability at the local level.

AB The remodeling construction method of wall type apartment buildings utilizing conventional Rahmen structural system has some drawback of compatibility of the beam depth between existing bearing wall apartment buildings and conventional Rahmen structural system. The pre-cast composite structural systems presented in this study are capable of providing the identical floor depth with conventional apartment buildings. Connecting steels between the existing structures and new frames are developed and presented. This paper also presents the energy efficiencies and related merits of the remodeling construction method of wall type apartment buildings. This work finally demonstrates that the use of pre-cast composite structural systems for the expansion of conventional wall type apartment buildings would reduce the overall amount of energy input compared to utilizing the wall structural system for remodeling.
   The energy consumptions of remodeling construction method with pre-cast composite structural systems were reduced by approximately 45% in comparison with conventional wall type expansion, demonstrating opportunity for the healthy expansion of existing apartment spaces in environmentally friendly and sustainable ways.

AB An approach for managing electrical demand through enhanced building operations in hot climates is evaluated and demonstrated in this paper. The approach focuses on implementing enhanced operations in government buildings, since they are easier to implement and administer. These enhanced operations included early reduction of cooling supply before the end of the occupancy period, improved time-of-day control after occupancy period and reduced lighting. A total of eight government buildings with different construction and system characteristics were selected for implementing these enhanced operations. These buildings have a total air-conditioning area of 4.39 x 10(5) m(2) and a combined peak electrical demand of 293 MW. The enhanced operations resulted in demand savings of 8.90 MW during the national peak hour. Temperatures build up inside the buildings were monitored and found to be within acceptable ranges.
   Guidelines for nationwide implementation in similar buildings were developed based on the results of this work. Implementation is estimated to reduce demand by 488 MW by the year 2030, which amounts to capital savings of $585 million. These projected values would be important to adopt energy efficient policies for the country. Additional reductions in energy and fuel consumption are added benefits, which would result in large financial and environmental savings to the country. Moreover, the enhanced building operations would be an important tool to avoid any blackouts by properly reducing the peak electrical demand as well as operating the power plants with a higher thermal efficiency.

TI ENERGY-EFFICIENT ARCHITECTURE IN SUSTAINABLE URBAN TOURISM
SO PROSTOR
LA Croatian
DT Article
DE ARCHITECTURE; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SUSTAINABILITY; URBAN TOURISM
AB The city as a tourist destination is a complex system with its own specific urban and architectural features. Sustainable urban tourism and architecture are unquestionably interdependent. This paper offers an evaluation of the urban hotels in European countries and in Croatia selected according to the established criteria. The analysis of the results suggests that in EU countries, a great deal of effort has been made to raise the level of responsibility of all participants and to apply the principles of sustainable development in tourism architecture. Nevertheless, the established principles have been consistently applied in only a limited number of the analyzed cases.
   The analyses of global tourism growth indicate that urban tourism is increasingly developing. A massive influx of tourists into the cities poses considerable challenges such as: the preservation of cultural resources and the built environment, the sustainability of social interaction between local citizens and tourists, waste management, increased energy consumption, increased carbon dioxide emissions to name but a few. Urban tourism is mostly developed in cities characterized by open urban spaces, nice parks, unique architectural and urban features, attractive material and non-material heritage, efficient transport services, famous universities, scientific and research facilities, shopping malls, high-quality restaurants, dynamic street life. Cities often serve as bases to those tourists who recognize an entire region as an attractive tourist destination. International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] offered the following sustainable principles as a basis for national programs: to limit the impact on the environment up to the carrying capacity level, to preserve the existing biological resources and biodiversity, to harmonize the consumption of non-renewable resources with the use of the renewable ones, to establish a fair distribution of benefits and costs of the use of resources, to apply technological processes which enhance the usability of the resources, to adjust economic policies to the protection of natural resources, to follow the principle of anticipation and collaboration between sectors (such as tourism, traffic and environmental protection) in decision-making processes, and to enhance and support cultural values based on sustainable principles.
   The availabe data indicate that presently there are 26 cities with more than in million inhabitants while 45 cities have populations between 5 and 10 millions. Globally, 54 per cent of the world population currently (2014) lives in urban areas. It is estimated that until 2050, around 66 per cent of the world population will live in cities. The EU, with 73 per cent of its population living in the cities, ranks third among the most urbanized world regions. In order to reduce the effects of the urban areas to an ecologically acceptable level, planning and design processes should take into consideration the assessment of ecological footprint, ecological deficit, urban heat islands, the availability (i.e. restriction) of land as a resource, traffic, waste, water and air quality, aerodynamic impact, and urban dust.
   Furthermore, planning and design processes in the context of energy-efficient architecture in sustainable urban tourism, require the application of energy-efficient concepts, elements and systems such as a sustainable urban concept, carrying capacity analysis in evaluation and choice of a site, planning the use of the site in a sustainable way, a sustainable architectural concept, the application of passive solar principles in architecture, ecology-based waste management, the participation of the users etc.
   There exist numerous organizations dealing with the assessment of energy-efficient, i.e. sustainable architecture in tourism. Those that are widely known are Green Leaf, Green Seal, Green Key and Eco-label, Green Tourism Business Scheme [GTBS], China's Green Hotel Standard [CGHS], LEED and BREEAM.
   The assessment of architecture in sustainable urban tourism was in this research preceded by an analysis of the most frequently used systems and evaluation methods. There are various criteria and structures of evaluation models. Generally, the structure of evaluation models is subdivided into three main dimensions which stem from a three-column model of sustainable development: the ecological, sociological and economic dimension. The ecological dimension can be further subdivided into: environmental protection, protection of nature and characteristics of a building.
   This research encompassed 142 green hotels in Europe and Croatia. The term green hotel denotes here an overarching concept for the following: green, energy-efficient, eco, environmentally friendly, sustainable hotel etc. They were selected on the basis of the available information found in literature and on Croatian and foreign web sites, which was used as a relevant criterion in their classification as green urban hotels. The hotels are situated in 58 cities in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
   After the data obtained from the survey of the green hotels had been processed, the representative examples were selected on the basis of the following criteria: the complexity of the project, originality of design solutions, the application of energy-efficient principles in their construction or renovation in the late 20th and the early 21st century, the level of their cultural, historical and geographical similarity to Croatian context. The research results show that none of the analyzed hotels meet any group of selection criteria entirely. The representative examples used in the analysis had to fulfil at least one subcriterion within seven out of ten main criteria groups.
   The research results indicate that a great deal of effort has been made in EU to promote the so-called green tourism. Furthermore, considerable effort has been put into ecological awareness-raising and in developing an appropriate sense of responsibility of all the participants but also on the implementation of sustainable development principles in all stages of architectural creation in urban tourism. However, a "greenwashing" effect has been detected in numerous cases.

TI SUSTAINABLE URBAN DESIGN A solar strategy for a sustainable city
SO ARCHITEKTURA & URBANIZMUS
LA Slovak
DT Article
AB Sustainable development is a key principle in the European Union. As a moral leader and pioneer in energy-efficient buildings, the EU is carrying out the first legislative steps by implementing the Europe 2020 strategy in real life. Currently, the energy-efficient solutions for individual buildings are common knowledge; now the focus is shifting from single objects towards further, more complex systems such as urban fragments, city districts or even whole cities. By 2050, cities will accommodate about 70% of world's population yet even at present, they are responsible for 80% of CO2 emissions. With this in mind, it is necessary, but also convenient, to look for solutions to global environmental problems within cities. Urban layout varies with many factors, such as local climate, topology, or cultural background, all of which need to be reflected in the new concepts of 21st-century energy-efficient urban design. On this matter, we have the opportunity to learn from the past the streets of cities emerging under Spanish influence were often laid out for conditions of greater sunlight, known as the Spanish grid.
   The present contribution presents a strategy for making cities more energy efficient by preferring local renewable energy sources while maintaining their identity and cultural heritage. Today we can reliably look for solutions in silico, through computer simulations. It is possible to evaluate quickly many urban variations including diverse aspects while saving considerable effort and energy.
   This focus of this study is on software generation of urban structures according to the position of the sun to maximize active and passive solar energy utilisation. The given approach creates nearly zero- or even plus-energy urban volumes, which are able to supply the energy surplus to their surroundings in an energy cooperation process, including even existing developments. In addition, the energy cooperation potential between basic typologies of city fragments was analysed. Solar potential was studied with regard to the two basic principles of solar energy utilization active (photovoltaic and photothermic conversion) and passive (transmission through building openings). With regard to these principles, the unobstructed solar exposition of corresponding surfaces is crucial and deserves far more attention in urban planning processes.
   The generation of urban structures was conducted by an algorithm written in the Rhino script Grasshopper. It is based on similar principles as the Solar Envelope of Ralph Knowles and extends them. Urban volumes are created by the following limitations defined by borders of tangential plots, the pre-set period from 20th March to 22nd September (defined through partial research and possible energy gains) and the time interval from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.. According to Juhani Pallasmaa, the process of creation is conducted through the connection between hand and mind. Therefore this process remains within the competence of architects and town planners the generating algorithm follows their intentions and afterwards optimises the areas to be built up. The final step is volumetric reduction from the southern direction, in order to create appropriate surfaces for solar appliances.
   The analysis of 3 resulting structures in comparison with "traditional" 4- and 8-storey urban typologies was performed on a reference plot of 4 ha. The boundary conditions of proposed buildings and structural elements correspond to the passive energy standard (15 kWh/m(2).a), average values of hot-water energy consumption (3.5 kWh/d.dw), and average household electricity consumption (6 kWh/d.dw). One dwelling was represented by 100 m2 gross floor area and was occupied by 2.5 persons. Transparent parts of buildings accounted for 30% on facades and 15% on roof surfaces. Two case studies were observed the first one was focused solely on the use of photovoltaic energy, while the second one included an equal surface shared by photovoltaic and photothermic sources.
   The results juxtapose the energy demands/ consumption of the analysed urban fragments and their solar energy potential. In case of PV-only structures, the energy gained can outbalance the needs at the level of nearly zero energy standards. The "traditional" urban typologies ranked better at the 4-storey level, but were surpassed by the second and third generated urban structures (Generated Structure 02 and 03). The other case which utilised energy from both photovoltaic and photothermic sources showed higher energy efficiency and better outcomes. All of the structures are rated at nearly zero energy standards or higher. The greatest energy surplus urban volume according to the summarization is Generated Structure 02, even though it does not display the highest solar energy gain potential. Generated Structure 03 can shelter the most inhabitants and enables the highest solar energy gains. Traditional low-rise urban types are not far behind and have quite good energy cooperation potential as well. Savings in household electricity consumption offer a certain space for further reduction of energy demands. Changes in user behaviour can have a great impact on overall energy needs. European studies have proven that a reduction to levels below 4 kWh/d.dw is definitely feasible.
   In addition to energy parameters, the volume characteristics and possible number of inhabitants need to be considered with regard to social factors, as the recommended population density is about 250 inhabitants/ha.
   Generation of solar urban structures, optimization of traditional urban typology or revitalisation of entire city districts all represent possible ways of creating a system of energysurplus urban fragments. Energy potential may be transformed into a synergy by means of an energy cooperation grid, in which historically valuable urban structures would receive needed energy from new urban developments. A persistent hurdle to renewable energy use is the financially demanding possibilities of energy storage. However, even in this field there are well-documented studies of diverse promising technologies. The concept of energy cooperation on the urban scale offers a solution for preservation of the identity and cultural heritage of cities and, at the same time, a balance and reliability of energy networks could be ensured. It is essential that energy from renewable sources is not only acquired but also is put to use within the neighbourhood or city. The implementation of the proposed concept needs to occur in the field of urban design. New energy indicators for town-planning have been defined.
   The cooperation indicator of the urban structure (or neighbourhood, district, city quarter) is meant to be a quantifier of the negative/positive energy balance of the urban structure's contribution to the synergy within an urban frame. It expresses either the structure's capability of offering its energy surplus or its energy demands with respect to adjoining structures or city quarters. Utilisation of the available renewable sources in real time is enabled by a local smart grid. Energy cooperation indicators reflect the potential of overproduction or the deficiency of a particular urban structure type in relation to a reference plot/area (e.g. 1 ha). The indicator varies from positive to negative values, and may be related to electrical (referred to as electric cooperation indicator ECI) or thermic (TOO energy (or any other applicable commodity).
   The solar index of an urban structure (or neighbourhood, district, city quarter) is defined as the ratio of the total amount of incident solar radiation on the surface of a specific urban structure during a period (of the year) to the total amount of irradiation of the corresponding plot attached to the urban structure. Using numbered values, the solar index indicates which part of the total solar radiation falling onto the given area is actually caught by the urban structure for its potential utilisation. The amount of harnessed energy depends on the observed period (specified according to he intended solar energy utilisation).
   Koen Steemers states that only the compact city can be energy-efficient. Compactness allows "material savings from extent", increasing infrastructure efficiency, lowering traffic demands or better use of soil. This paper presents ways to design denser urban areas while preserving healthy living through an optimally sunlit environment. Policies for appropriate passive and active solar energy utilisation and coordination of energy flows in urban areas must be specified and executed by municipal authorities. The chief difficulty within the given concept is, as always, user behaviour. Therefore, reduction of energy consumption relies on proper education and public demonstration of best-practice examples. These are the starting points for urban development in the 21st century.

AB The objective of this paper is to close the scientific gap that there is a lack of comprehensive matching analysis for the increasingly complicated on-site hybrid energy systems with a continuously decreased annual primary energy consumption/equivalent CO2 emission. Thus, a thorough matching analysis is conducted for the on-site hybrid systems of two office buildings under distinct climate conditions. Both of the studied buildings are equipped with PV and solar thermal assisted ground source heat pumps (GSHP), which can be controlled by six excess renewable electrical (REe) and one excess renewable thermal (REth) treatments with respect to certain thermal storage recharging and grid exporting strategies. The assessment criteria are six recently defined indices. With the aid of these indices, the key methodology is to conduct parametric analyses from the aspect of matching for solar thermal collector area and connection type, PV panel area, and electrical battery size regarding certain excess REe or REth treatments. The outcomes of matching analyses show the advantages of solar thermal collectors connected in a parallel fashion in meeting office heating demands, the consistency between electrical generation and demand in the daytime in office buildings, the enhancement of on-site heating and cooling by GSHP and free ground cooling, and the battery effect in technically improving electrical matching. Furthermore, the fluctuations of indices in the instantaneous matching analysis clearly reflect the matching situations of on-site renewable energy resources and demand conditions at each time-step, which will be helpful for the detailed investigation of specific system operations and user behaviours. It has been shown that the methodology used in the study can be helpful for aiding the design of increasingly complicated on-site hybrid energy systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study is the technical and economic evaluation of a typical solar space and water heating system, utilized in an 88 m(2) detached house that is designed according to the latest Greek Regulation on the Energy Performance of Buildings as a means toward Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). The analysis was conducted for each of the four climatic zones designated in the Greek Regulation. A financial analysis was performed and the Net Present Value and the Discounted Payback Period (DPBP) were calculated and correlated with the solar systems collector area and the storage tank volume. Furthermore, the annual avoided emissions from the substituted fossil fuels are estimated for the solar systems considered. The analysis demonstrates that the typical solar space and water heating system can provide a viable solution toward NZEB with solar coverage and DPBP being strongly influenced by the climatic zone of the building and the type of fossil fuel substituted. In all cases the solar system covers at least 45% of the total heating loads while the payback period is as low as 4.5 years with an annual abatement of more than 50 t of CO2 in the worst case scenario.

AB Seawater heat pump (SWHP) systems are considered as an ideal approach to heat and cool buildings in coastal areas due to its attractive advantages of high efficiency, low carbon emission and using renewable energy instead of electricity for heating and cooling. A great many of SWHP systems have been applied in residential and commercial buildings successfully. In this paper, models describing the coupled seepage and heat transfer process of beach well infiltration intake systems for a SWHP were established and validated by field experiment. In addition, the performance of the beach well infiltration intake system was simulated. And effect of the parameters related to the beach well and the operation of the system on pumping water temperature was explored through a series of simulations. As a result, application of SWHP systems with beach well infiltration intake system in coastal areas in China is feasible due to the favorable geographical conditions and environment.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper describes the multifunctional complex "Solaria": a development project of an unused industrial area, located in a urban district in the immediate outskirts of Perugia (Italy), conceived and designed according to principles of sustainable buildings. Energy efficiency solutions and innovative experimental components are synergically integrated in a single project, enabling to reach important results, as demonstrated by the assessment of environmental achievements and the calculation of avoided CO2 emissions. Since a quantitative evaluation of the energy savings, that can be achieved with the use of bioclimatic greenhouses, is very complex, due to the large number of parameters,which are necessary to describe their operation, the research work focused on the thermo-fluid dynamic modeling of these systems, with the use of a specific CFD-FEM software, COMSOL Multiphysics (TM).
   In particular a model was created, initially conceived in 2D and currently developed in 3D, which reproduces the thermo-fluid dynamic behavior of an experimental greenhouse in the Solaria complex. The possibility of changing parameters characterizing materials and climatic conditions allowed to appreciate the influence on energy performance of special reinforced thermal insulation, solar control glasses and external sliding sunshades. A further added value is the possibility to simulate an organic thin-film photovoltaic device of nanometric thickness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MODEL; PERFORMANCE
AB In the UK, the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is used to rate the energy performance of existing dwellings whenever they are let or sold. This study investigates which of the inputs to SAP account for the most variance in energy rating across existing gas central heated houses in England. Data from the English Housing Survey (EHS) 2009 are used to generate a representative set of dwellings and variance-based global sensitivity analysis is then applied to assess each input's contribution to the variance in the calculated ratings. It is demonstrated that heating system efficiency, external wall U-value and dwelling geometry account for 75% of the variance of the energy rating of gas central heated houses in England. This suggests that improving heating system efficiencies and wall U-values of the worst performing dwellings will go a long way towards improving their energy rating and potentially reducing their energy consumption. It is also demonstrated that dwelling geometry has a much bigger influence on the calculated carbon emissions (accounting for 80% of the variance) than it does on the SAP energy rating (accounting for 30%), meaning that significant improvements in energy rating might not be accompanied by significant reductions in carbon emissions.

AB Food retail buildings account for a measurable proportion of a country's energy consumption and resultant carbon emissions so energy-operating costs are key business considerations. Increased understanding of end-use energy demands in this sector can enable development of effective benchmarking systems to underpin energy management tools. This could aid identification and evaluation of interventions to reduce operational energy demand. Whilst there are a number of theoretical and semi-empirical benchmarking and thermal modelling tools that can be used for food retail building stocks, these do not readily account for the variance of technical and non-technical factors that can influence end-use demands.
   This paper discusses the various drivers of energy end-uses of typical UK food retail stores. It reports on an empirical study of one organisation's hypermarket stock to evaluate the influence of various factors on annual store electricity and gas demands. Multiple regression models are discussed in the context of the development and application of a methodology for estimating annual energy end-use demand in food retail buildings. The established models account for 75% of the variation in electricity demand, 50% of the variation in gas demand in stores without CHP and 77% of the variation in gas demand in stores with CHP.

AB This paper deals with the environmental resources consumed to construct tall building structures; the consumption is measured by the energy required to obtain tall building structures and is expressed in terms of cradle-to-gate embodied energy.
   A reference structure composed of central core (made of reinforced concrete) and rigid frames (made of either reinforced concrete or steel) is considered. The reference structure is dimensioned and detailed for buildings from 20 to 70 stories; the embodied energy of each building is then estimated (total, of the components, per net rentable area).
   The results show that, if some design decisions are dictated by the embodied energy, the premium for height of the embodied energy is not substantial, which proves that tall building structures can be sustainable. However, a structure with the lowest weight does not imply the lowest embodied energy. The results also prove that the embodied energy depends mainly on the flooring system, and that steel consumes more embodied energy than Reinforced Concrete.
   Ultimately, the embodied energy is confirmed to be a viable tool to design sustainable tall buildings, and the results presented herein may address design toward minimizing the embodied energy, which means to save environmental resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fire is an important global ecological process that influences the distribution of biomes, with consequences for carbon, water, and energy budgets. Therefore it is impossible to appropriately model the history and future of the terrestrial ecosystems and the climate system without including fire. This study incorporates the process-based prognostic fire module SPITFIRE into the global vegetation model ORCHIDEE, which was then used to simulate burned area over the 20th century. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of other fire regime indicators such as seasonality, fire size and fire length, next to burned area. For 2001-2006, the simulated global spatial extent of fire agrees well with that given by satellite-derived burned area data sets (L3JRC, GLOBCARBON, GFED3.1), and 76-92% of the global burned area is simulated as collocated between the model and observation, depending on which data set is used for comparison. The simulated global mean annual burned area is 346 Mha yr(-1), which falls within the range of 287-384 Mha yr(-1) as given by the three observation data sets; and is close to the 344 Mha yr(-1) by the GFED3.1 data when crop fires are excluded. The simulated long-term trend and variation of burned area agree best with the observation data in regions where fire is mainly driven by climate variation, such as boreal Russia (1930-2009), along with Canada and US Alaska (1950-2009). At the global scale, the simulated decadal fire variation over the 20th century is only in moderate agreement with the historical reconstruction, possibly because of the uncertainties of past estimates, and because land-use change fires and fire suppression are not explicitly included in the model. Over the globe, the size of large fires (the 95th quantile fire size) is underestimated by the model for the regions of high fire frequency, compared with fire patch data as reconstructed from MODIS 500 m burned area data. Two case studies of fire size distribution in Canada and US Alaska, and southern Africa indicate that both number and size of large fires are underestimated, which could be related with short fire patch length and low daily fire size. Future efforts should be directed towards building consistent spatial observation data sets for key parameters of the model in order to constrain the model error at each key step of the fire modelling.

AB The method behind the UK Display Energy Certificate (DEC) improves the comparability of benchmarking by accounting for variations in weather and occupancy. To improve the comparability further, the incorporation of other features that are intrinsic to buildings (e.g. built form and building services) deserve exploration. This study investigates the impact of these features and explores ways to improve further comparability in benchmarking the energy performance of schools. Statistical analyses of approximately 7700 schools were performed, followed by analyses of causal factors in 465 schools in greater detail using artificial neural networks (ANNs), each designed to understand and identify the factors that have significant impact on the pattern of energy use of schools. Changes in the pattern of energy use of schools have occurred over the past four years. This fact highlights issues associated with static benchmarks. A significant difference in energy performance between primary and secondary schools meant that it was necessary to re-examine the way non-domestic buildings are classified. Factors were identified as having significant impact on the pattern of energy use. The characteristics raise new possibilities for developing sector-specific methods and improving comparability.

AB Understanding activities within premises can contribute to a fuller understanding of energy use within buildings and the building stock. Analysis of detailed surveys of over 300 non-domestic premises has produced empirical room-scale space-use profiles for 16 premises types. Electricity consumption and internal gains resulting from the operation of electrical appliances have been characterized for 295 combinations of internal space use and premises activity type. For each combination, the outputs include the energy-use intensity (kWh/m(2)/year) profiles for: overall appliance consumption; 14 end uses of appliances (e.g. lighting, catering, computing); and 18 groups of appliance activity descriptions (e.g. sales, office work, process). These profiles of characteristics were created for application in an urban-scale energy-use model, based upon premises floor space recorded in property taxation data, without the need for detailed energy surveys of premises. Appliance electricity consumption and internal gains are revealed at a finer spatial resolution than previous methods, indicating the diversity of energy-use characteristics in greater detail than for entire homogenized premises or premises types. This method may be used for evaluating the current electricity consumption and consequent carbon emissions from the non-domestic building stock (or parts thereof) and for estimating the effects of potential interventions.

AB Policy for reducing carbon emissions from non-domestic buildings in the UK relies at present on survey and modelling work carried out in the 1990s. The UK government's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is engaged in a programme of new research to update this evidence base. The work has two main components. The first is a database - the National Energy Efficiency Data framework (NEED) - in which floor area and activity data for non-domestic premises are being linked to electricity and gas consumption at the individual property level. The second is a research project of sample surveys designed to elicit information about buildings and energy use, but also opportunities for abatement and the behavioural and organizational factors affecting efficiency improvements. A pilot survey of the food and mixed retail sector has been carried out in advance of further surveys of the entire range of building types. The research programme is described along with some of the methodological problems it raises.

AB The production and use of cereal straw as a base material to make building envelopes in the Andean Patagonian region have been investigated. Energy used and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in local manufacturing of construction materials for walls based on wheat straw were obtained, as well as cropland required for different construction techniques. Two options for the use of straw to fill envelop walls were investigated: the direct use of straw bales, whether in whole or in halves, and the manufacturing of straw-clay blocks. The former has the best thermal conductivity but requires larger cultivation areas to satisfy wall demands, whilst the latter could be an option including moderate thermal efficiency and better cropland performance. Per wall surface unit, energy use and GHG emissions of all straw options were significantly lower compared to fired bricks or to concrete blocks. Furthermore, all straw options analysed result in significantly better thermal performance than current choices of fired bricks or concrete blocks, which are commonly used in the region. The present results show a relevant role of renewable agricultural products in lowering impacts of building materials, as well as options for sustainable production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Residential buildings comprise the biggest segment of the European building stock and they are responsible for the majority of the building's sector energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This paper documents the potential benefits and sets the priorities of individual energy conservation measures (ECMs) to reduce heating energy consumption in Hellenic residential buildings, including space heating and domestic hot water production. The analysis is facilitated by using the available Hellenic typology for residential buildings that consists of 24 typical buildings, derived after a classification in three construction periods, two building sizes and four climate zones. The focus is mainly on the implementation of ECMs that have low first-cost investment and short payback period. In order to prioritize ECMs that would be most attractive to building owners, two ranking criteria are used, namely primary heating energy savings and payback period. Finally, the preliminary results are used to provide an insight on the potential abatement of CO2 emissions for the national residential building stock. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SOLAR COOLING SYSTEMS
AB Trigeneration, which is able to provide cooling, heating and power, has been advocated to be a sustainable solution for building use in the urban area. With the high-temperature feature and maintenance convenience, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) becomes a promising prime mover of trigeneration. In this study, two zero grid-electricity design strategies of SOFC-trigeneration system for high-rise building were proposed and evaluated. The first zero design approach, named full-SOFC strategy, is to design the rated capacity of SOFC by matching the demand peak of electrical power without the need of grid connection. The second one, called partial-SOFC strategy, is to satisfy the peak electrical demand partly by the SOFC and partly by the grid, but still maintaining net zero grid-electricity in a year time. In view of the system complexity and the component interaction of SOFC-trigeneration, the environmental and energy performances of different cases were evaluated through year-round dynamic simulation. Compared to the conventional provisions of cooling, heating and power for building, the full- and the partial-SOFC-trigeneration systems could have 51.4% and 23.9% carbon emission cut per annum respectively. In terms of year-round electricity demand, the two zero grid-electricity strategies had corresponding savings of 7.1% and 2.8%. As a whole, the full-SOFC-trigeneration assures both environmental and energy merits for high-rise building in the hot and humid climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EFFICIENCY; BUILDINGS
AB This study estimates energy consumption and related GHG emissions for the buildings and facilities of the main university campus at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The campus has a built area of 13 km(2). Based on the strategic plan of growth, a scenario analysis for 2020 was also developed estimating baseline and mitigation scenarios that include energy efficiency technologies and solar water heating. To estimate energy consumption, a representative sample of buildings and facilities by category was selected in order to develop level I and when possible level II energy audits. The study was complemented with results of level III energy audits performed in previous studies for some buildings. The bottom-up results from energy audits were compared to the electricity bill for the whole campus. We found that lighting represents 28% of total energy use, followed by special research equipment 17%, refrigeration 14%, and water heating that includes the Olympic swimming pool 9%. If energy efficiency technologies are applied for retrofitting and considered for new buildings in lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning; and a hybrid system (solar-electric-LPG) is used for water heating, energy consumption could be 7.5% less than in 2011 and CO2 emissions 11.3% less than in 2011.

TI Neighborhood form and CO2 emission: evidence from 23

SO FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE CO2 emission; neighborhood type; transportation; household energy; China
ID URBAN FORM; ENERGY; IMPACT; TRAVEL
AB To understand the household CO2 emission level in China, as well as how much the neighborhoods' socio-economic or design factors could influence the CO2 emission, 23 neighborhoods in Jinan were investigated in 2009 and 2010. These neighborhoods fall into four different types: superblock, enclave, grid and traditional. The household CO2 emission includes sources of both inhome energy use and passenger transportation. The average CO2 emission per household is 7.66 t center dot a-1, including 6.87 t in-home operational emission and 792 kg transportation emission. The household CO2 emission by neighborhood categories is 10.97, 5.65, 6.49, 5.40 t center dot household(-1)center dot a(-1) for superblock, enclave, grid and traditional respectively. Superblock has the highest average emission and also the highest percent (more than 25%) of transportation emission among four different types of neighborhoods. The residential CO2 emission of superblock neighborhoods in Jinan has already reached the level in developed countries nearly ten years ago. It is predictable that more superblock neighborhoods would be built in China with the fast urbanization. How to avoid the rapid household CO2 emission growth in the future would be a systematic issue. The study also found that in addition to income and apartment area, household density, land use mix and accessibility to public transportation are three primary factors which have significant impacts on CO2 emission. High density, mixed land use and convenient accessibility to public transportation tend to reduce household CO2 emission.

TI Do smart grids offer a new incentive for SME carbon reduction?
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Carbon emissions; SMEs; Smart grids
ID NONDOMESTIC BUILDINGS; ENERGY; CLASSIFICATION
AB Collectively small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are significant energy users although many are unregulated by existing policies due to their low carbon emissions. Carbon reduction is often not a priority but smart grids may create a new opportunity. A smart grid will give electricity suppliers a picture of real-time energy flows and the opportunity for consumers to receive financial incentives for engaging in demand side management. In addition to creating incentives for local carbon reduction, engaging SMEs with smart grids has potential for contributing to wider grid decarbonisation.
   Modelling of buildings, business activities and technology solutions is needed to identify opportunities for carbon reduction. The diversity of the SME sector complicates strategy development. SMEs are active in almost every business area and occupy the full range of property types. This paper reviews previous modelling work, exposing valuable data on floor space and energy consumption associated with different business activities. Limitations are seen with the age of this data and an inability to distinguish SME energy use.
   By modelling SME energy use, electrical loads are identified which could be shifted on demand, in a smart network. Initial analysis of consumption, not constrained by existing policies, identifies heating and cooling in retail and commercial offices as having potential for demand response. Hot water in hotel and catering and retail sectors may also be significant because of the energy storage potential. Areas to consider for energy efficiency schemes are also indicated.

AB We constructed a model to assess the carbon balance of harvested wood products (HWP) used for building, furniture, paper/paperboard and energy, taking into account flows of wood between regions of Japan. We projected the carbon balance in each region until 2050 under two future scenarios, a BAU (business as usual) scenario and a wood use promotion scenario. We found the carbon stock in domestic harvested wood products became a carbon emission source, with Central Japan becoming the largest emission source, after 2020 in the BAU scenario but continued to function as a carbon sink in every region over the whole period in the wood promotion scenario. Therefore, unless future supply and demand amounts of domestic wood are increased by factors such as policies promoting the use of wood, the carbon stock of domestic wood may become an emission source rather than a sink. By promoting the use of domestic wood, the carbon stock acts as a carbon sink in every region. Carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption with respect to HWP in the whole of Japan fell to 72% of the 2004 value in 2050 in the BAU scenario, but rose to 112% in the wood promotion scenario. Emissions from wood transport were greatest in Central Japan, emissions from sawn wood processing were highest in West Japan, and emissions from plywood processing and woodchip processing were greatest in East Japan. In carbon balances that included the annual changes in the carbon stock amounts of domestic harvested wood, only Central Japan in the wood promotion scenario had carbon removals greater than its carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption in the years 2005-2045. In addition, when considering reductions in carbon emissions by substitution of fossil fuels with wood residues and waste wood in the carbon balances, the sum of the removals from carbon stock changes and the reductions of carbon emissions were greater than the carbon emissions associated with HWP over the entire period in all three regions in both scenarios.

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Urban boundary; Carbon emissions; Gridded dataset
ID GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENERGY USE; CONSUMPTION; INVENTORY; CITY
AB Different names/concepts and therefore different spatial boundaries for cities in China are responsible for the conflicting and confusing results associated with urban CO2 emissions accounting. In this study, four types of urban boundaries, i.e., city administrative boundary (U131), city district boundary (UB2), city built-up area (UB3) and urban proper (U134), were identified and defined. Tianjin was subsequently selected as the case city to illustrate the different performances of CO2 emissions with respect to these four boundaries using a 1-km grid dataset built bottom-up by point-emission sources. Different urban boundaries can induce a difference in CO2 emissions as large as 654%. UBi and UB2 are not the appropriate proxies for urban boundaries in the analysis of urban CO2 emissions, although UB1 is a widely adopted boundary. UB3 is a good representative of city clusters and urban sprawl in a certain region, whereas UB4 is the appropriate system boundary for such issues as urban CO2 emissions in light of landscape characteristics and pertinent human activities, as well as the comparability to counterparts in developed countries. These results provide sound policy implications for the improvement of urban energy management and carbon emission abatement in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improvements in the building stock insulation and the replacement of heating systems will have to take place within the next decades in order to lower heat demand and the associated carbon emissions of the building sector. The current study presents an integrated, iterative modelling approach to determine the development of the heating market. A system model captures the fundamental influencing factors on the investment decision while a logistic decision model describes in detail the building owners' behaviour, taking into account the heterogeneous building stock and possible non-economic factors influencing heating system choice. In the application case, the potentials for different heating technologies are investigated under three different economic scenarios for the German heating market until 2050. The heating market with house owners as the main actors is relatively sluggish, thus political targets are likely to fail. The impact of the heat pump induced electricity demand on the power market remains low. In order to achieve the ambitious heating market targets in Germany further efforts are necessary. In particular the potentials of the existing building stock need to be taped more efficiently. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Friction is an essential part of human experience. We need traction to walk, stand, work, and drive. At the same time, we need energy to overcome the resistance to motion, hence, too much friction costs excess energy to perform work, introducing inefficiencies. In the 21st century, we are facing the dual challenges of energy shortage and global warming from burning fossil fuels. Therefore, the ability to control friction has become a top priority in our world today. Yet our understanding of the fundamental nature of friction is still lacking.
   Friction has always been a subject of curiosity. Intensive study of the origin of friction began in the 16th century, after the pioneering work by Leonardo da Vinci. Yet progress in understanding the nature of friction has been slow, hampered by the lack of instrument to measure friction precisely. Ingenious experiments performed by Amontons, Coulomb, and others have yielded important insights to build the foundation of our understanding. Beginning in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the advent of steam engines, locomotives, followed by the automobiles airplanes, and space exploration demands a clear understanding of friction and the ability to control it for the machinery to last. Significant progress on how to apply and control friction in engineering friction was made through trial and error. At the beginning of the 21st century, a new dimension of nanoscale friction came into the picture in conjunction with the arrival of nanotechnology. Our understanding of atomic and molecular friction has been expanding rapidly. However, integration of the new found knowledge of nanofriction into engineering practices has been elusive. Why? What is the scaling relationship between atomic friction and macro-friction? Is it possible to predict friction at the macro-level from nanoscale results? Why nanofriction values often do not agree with the macrofriction values given the same materials pair? Could it be there is a length scale dependent characteristic friction value?
   In engineering practice, progress since the 1980s has been slow. Most of the effort has been focused on lubrication research such as elastohydrodynamic theories and solid lubricants. Friction mechanisms and failures have received relative little attention while nanofriction received much of the attention.
   Today, energy efficiency and renewable energy generation demand our immediate attention while we seek reduction in carbon emission. The ability to control friction becomes an essential step in seeking sustainable technologies. Friction, after all, is an indicator of energy efficiency. If we can reduce the unnecessary parasitic energy losses and increase our current energy efficiency, it will give us time to develop alternative energy sources. This paper examines our current understanding of friction, filling some voids with experimental data, and attempts to integrate the various pieces to identify the gaps of our knowledge, hopefully to spark new avenues of investigations into this important area.

AB To pursue the sustainable development of industry, China has been developing eco-industrial parks for more than a decade. However, the low-carbon performance of eco-industrial parks is unverified. In this study, a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions inventory for industrial parks was established, including three sectors: energy consumption, industrial processes and product use, and waste. The Beijing Economic Technological Development Area (BDA), a typical national eco-industrial park of China, was chosen for a case study. The results show that the total greenhouse gas emissions of the eco-industrial park were 3.16 Mt CO(2)e in 2010, and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 97% of the total. The greenhouse gas emissions increased by 94% from 2005 to 2010. However, the greenhouse gas emissions intensity decreased by 20%, mainly due to optimization of the energy structure and improvements in energy efficiency. The share of non-industrial sectors in the total greenhouse gas emissions increased from 12% to 33%, and the construction industry became the second biggest emissions source, after manufacturing. Scenario analysis indicates that greenhouse gas emissions in the eco-industrial park could be lower than the 2010 levels as eco-industrial development proceeds, but more efforts are needed to improve energy and material efficiency. The case study has great implications for low-carbon development in other industrial parks. It is vital to build the low-carbon economy by implementing policies that will expand eco-industrial park practice and promote low-carbon development in more than 1500 industrial parks in China.

AB The need to maintain an ever-increasing building stock especially in developed economies is growing. This study provides a computational framework to find the optimal solution for sustainable building maintenance. The methodology is composed of two major steps. First, the authors evaluate the life-cycle carbon emission, cost, and labor requirements of a project, which embody important environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainable building maintenance. Second, the authors develop an optimization model to identify the optimal portfolio of materials that would minimize three sustainability objectives including carbon emission, cost, and labor deployment in their respective turns one at a time. By testing the model with seven scenarios in a case study, the authors demonstrate how this typical case project could significantly improve its sustainability objectives from environmental, economic, and social perspectives. This optimization methodology is generic. It can be readily applied to other new and nonresidential projects of varying scales and in circumstances with a different set of decision criteria. Finally, policy suggestions are proposed to promote sustainable building maintenance in Hong Kong.

AB The use of semi-transparent BIPV as a form of on-site renewable energy generation in energy efficient sustainable buildings is increasing. Its popularity is due to its contribution towards zero-(or even plus) energy buildings. In urban cities where the buildings have limited rooftop area but large facade areas, adopting semi-transparent BIPV windows is an alternative for conventional windows. The semi-transparent BIPV windows not only solely generate electricity but also affect the buildings' electricity usage through daylighting and heat gain/loss. In tropical climates where it is hot and humid all year round, the importance of window facade elements is even more pertinent due to high cooling load from the solar heat gains.
   This paper examines the life cycle environmental and economic performance of commercially available semi-transparent BIPV modules for window application under the tropical conditions of Singapore. Energy simulations, previously performed, were adopted to conduct a life cycle assessment to determine the long term performance in terms of energy and carbon emissions, as well as cost considerations. The EPBT and EROEI for the modules ranged from 0.68 to 1.98 and 11.72 to 34.49 respectively. After considering government subsidies, some modules cost lower than conventional windows, while half of the remaining modules, achieved payback periods of 1.1-13.1 years. These performance indicators were used to form a decision-making tool to assist architects and building designers in the selection of BIPV modules for windows during the early design stages.

AB Structural and energy consumption details from the secondary school buildings of Cyprus are presented in this paper. The study identifies the prevailing building practices in schools' construction in the three climatic zones of Cyprus, coastal, inland and mountainous. Furthermore the construction details of schools are compared with their energy consumption. In this questionnaire survey 24 schools were responded with a completed profile and represent the 15% of schools and through further interviews and in situ visits more data are collected from a percentage of 60% of the secondary schools in Cyprus. The analysis through questionnaire results conclude to significant findings which are very revealing and may be used as a preliminary study on energy upgrading of schools.
   Furthermore through a statistical study the construction details of the mean typical secondary school building in Cyprus are also derived. A case study with simulations for the energy performance of a representative typical school building is also developed. Variables of the building elements are examined through parametric simulations using the software iSBEMcy. This is the official governmental software used for the categorization of energy efficiency in buildings and the calculation of CO2 emissions according to the European Directive 2002/91/EC. Based on the energy categorization of the building six retrofitting scenarios are studied in simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A solar membrane liquid desiccant air conditioning (S-M-LDAC) system is proposed and investigated in this study. Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are used for humid air dehumidification and dilute desiccant solution regeneration in the S-M-LDAC system. This eliminates the problem of desiccant droplets carry over in supply and exhaust air streams, which limits the wide use of conventional direct-contact liquid desiccant air conditioning systems in commercial/residential applications. Eight systems configurations, which mainly differ in the heating and air systems, are simulated using the TRNSYS building energy simulation software. Four heating systems are investigated as follows: (i) natural gas boiler, (ii) electrical heat pump, (iii) solar thermal system (STS) with natural gas boiler backup, and (iv) STS with electrical heat pump backup. Two air systems are studied one with and one without an energy recovery ventilator. Parametric studies are performed to study the influences of the collector area and storage volume of hot water tank relative to collector area on the annual solar fraction, annual collector efficiency and life cycle cost. The size of the STS is optimized to give the lowest life cycle cost, and then the economic and environmental performances are evaluated for the systems studied by calculating the initial cost, annual operating cost, life cycle cost, payback period and annual CO2 emissions. Results show that using a STS to cover the thermal energy required to regenerate the dilute desiccant solution significantly improves the economic and environmental performances of the systems studied, with more significant reductions when a natural gas boiler is used as the backup heating system and there is no energy recovery ventilator.

AB This paper explores the extent to which global fuel use in buildings could be reduced, and the growth in global electricity use in buildings limited, by applying stringent (factor of 3-4) improvements to recent building codes for new buildings worldwide and large (factor of 2-3) reductions in the energy use of existing buildings through renovations. The analysis is carried out for 10 different socio-economic regions of the world, taking into account existing building stock and energy intensities in each region and projected changes in population and income, which in most parts of the world will drive large increases in building floor area. A stock turnover model is applied to project changes in heating, cooling, service hot water (SHW) and non-thermal electricity demand with various rates of improvement in standards for new and renovated buildings, and various rates of renovation and demolition of existing buildings. For a scenario in which population peaks at about 9 billion and global average per capita GDP increases to twice the 2010 value by 2100, the global fuel demand could be reduced by a factor of four while limiting maximum annual electricity demand to twice the 2010 value.

ID RETROFIT; IMPACT; LIFE
AB One of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada is the buildings sector, with over 30% of national energy end-use occurring in buildings. Energy use must be addressed to reduce emissions from the buildings sector, as nearly 70% of all Canada's energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil sources. An analysis of GHG emissions from the existing residential building stock for the year 2010 has been conducted for six Canadian cities with different climates and development histories: Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax. Variation across these cities is seen in their 2010 GHG emissions, due to climate, characteristics of the building stock, and energy conversion technologies, with Halifax having the highest per capita emissions at 5.55 tCO(2)e/capita and Montreal having the lowest at 0.32 tCO(2)e/capita. The importance of the provincial electricity grid's carbon intensity is emphasized, along with era of construction, occupancy, floor area, and climate. Approaches to achieving deep emissions reductions include innovative retrofit financing and city level residential energy conservation by-laws; each region should seek location-appropriate measures to reduce energy demand within its residential housing stock, as well as associated GHG emissions.

AB China is the second largest building energy user in the world, ranking first and third in residential and commercial energy consumption. Beginning in the early 1980s, the Chinese government has developed a variety of building energy codes to improve building energy efficiency and reduce total energy demand. This paper studies the impact of building energy codes on energy use and CO2 emissions by using a detailed building energy model that represents four distinct climate zones each with three building types, nested in a long-term integrated assessment framework GCAM. An advanced building stock module, coupled with the building energy model, is developed to reflect the characteristics of future building stock and its interaction with the development of building energy codes in China. This paper also evaluates the impacts of building codes on building energy demand in the presence of economy-wide carbon policy. We find that building energy codes would reduce Chinese building energy use by 13-22% depending on building code scenarios, with a similar effect preserved even under the carbon policy. The impact of building energy codes shows regional and sectoral variation due to regionally differentiated responses of heating and cooling services to shell efficiency improvement.

AB Improving the energy efficiency of building stock, commercial equipment, and household appliances can have a major positive impact on energy use, carbon emissions, and building services. Sub-national regions such as the U.S. states wish to increase energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, or adapt to climate change. Evaluating sub-national policies to reduce energy use and emissions is difficult because of the large uncertainties in socioeconomic factors, technology performance and cost and energy and climate policies. Climate change itself may undercut such policies. However, assessing all of the uncertainties of large-scale energy and climate models by performing thousands of model runs can be a significant modeling effort with its accompanying computational burden. By applying fractional-factorial methods to the GCAM-USA 50-state integrated-assessment model in the context of a particular policy question, this paper demonstrates how a decision-focused sensitivity analysis strategy can greatly reduce computational burden in the presence of uncertainty and reveal the important drivers for decisions and more detailed uncertainty analysis.

AB A novel calculation tool (REMA) for assessing the effects of various energy efficiency measures in buildings on the scale of the whole building stock of Finland is presented along with an estimate concerning the most recent changes in the regulation for energy use in buildings. REMA is a bottom-up model that uses representative building types (archetypes) for estimating energy consumption in different segments of the building stock. Future developments are estimated using annual rates of new construction, renovations and removals from the building stock. REMA was used to calculate the development of energy use in the building stock after the latest changes to the Finnish building code. For this purpose, the energy demands of the different standard building types were simulated using the IDA-ICE 4.2 dynamic simulation program. The results show a decrease of about 3% in heating energy consumption to 70.0 TWh and a 6% increase in electricity consumption to 19.7 TWh by the year 2020 corresponding to a reduction of 2% in total energy consumption. For CO2 emissions, a decrease of about 4% can be expected by 2020 concerning all energy use in the building stock. Over longer periods of time, the pace of reductions is accelerated as the share of new buildings in the stock grows larger. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Generally, doorways are the part of a cold storage rooms where maximum energy gains and losses occur. The main purpose of this research is to achieve a more efficient energy control for these areas. To do this, a comprehensive study of a climate separation system with highly efficient air curtains has been conducted. Not only the energy consumption has been analyzed but also the carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, as well as the cost effectiveness of different alternatives. The results of the study, from the viewpoint of energy performance and amortization period, show that using high efficiency air curtains as a climate separation is a cleaner and cheaper solution than other commonly used systems. It reduces heat gains and losses through the door of the storage room by 80% compared with a physical separation solution. The simplicity of the installation makes these systems feasible not only in new buildings, but also in buildings under construction or refurbishment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building energy efficiency rating systems have been established worldwide to systematically manage the energy consumption of existing buildings. This study aimed to develop a new energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings from two perspectives: (i) establishment of reasonable and fair criteria for the building energy efficiency rating system; and (ii) establishment of comparative incentive and penalty programs to encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign. Based on the analysis of the conventional energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings, this study was conducted in five steps: (i) data collection and analysis; (ii) correlation analysis between the household size and the CO2 emission density (i.e., CO2 emission per unit area); (iii) cluster formation based on results of the correlation analysis using a decision tree; (iv) establishment of a new energy efficiency rating system for existing buildings; and (v) establishment of incentive and penalty programs using advanced case-based reasoning. The proposed system can allow a policymaker to establish a reasonable and fair energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings and can encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign.

AB Retrofit actions applied to the existent building stock aim at increasing the energy performance, considering the optimal trade-off between energy savings and costs, according to the Directive 2010/31/EU. To select effective refurbishment measures and to quantify the energy saving potentials of the existent building stock, the analysis should be performed on "reference buildings".
   This article presents a methodology for the identification of reference buildings, according to the IEE-TABULA project (2009-12) aimed at creating a harmonised structure for "European Building Typologies". Among the possible applications of the building typology, this work focuses on the potentialities of energy savings and CO2 emission reductions for the European residential building stock. In particular, the Italian approach to model the energy balance of a subset of the national building stock is described; the results show the enormous potentialities of energy savings even with basic energy retrofit actions. Cost analyses were not in the scope of the project, but the results of this study are the basis for further investigations aimed at assessing the cost effectiveness of sets of measures. In this regard, the TABULA building-types are being applied by the Italian government for calculating cost-optimal levels of energy performance, complying with the Directive 2010/31/EU objectives.

AB To better understand the role of sustainable urban development in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, this study examines the paths by which urban form influences an individual household's carbon dioxide emissions in the 125 largest urbanized areas in the U.S. Our multilevel SEM analyses show that doubling population-weighted density is associated with a reduction in CO2 emissions from household travel and residential energy consumption by 48% and 35%, respectively. Centralized population and polycentric structures have only a moderate impact in our analyses. Given that household travel and residential energy use account for 42% of total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, these findings highlight the importance of smart growth policies to build more compact and transit friendly cities as a crucial part of any strategic efforts to mitigate GHG emissions and to stabilize climate.

AB Buildings have negative effects on the environment throughout their life cycle, i.e. from the phase of obtaining raw materials and manufacturing materials and components up to the sale, building and use through the final phase of removal when the building is decommissioned. In general, current legislation limits both the use of energy and the emissions allowed during operation, but does not limit the other parameters. that define the design of contemporary sustainable buildings. Determining the sustainability of buildings should take place in the planning phase of the project, when it is still possible to influence the outcome. In this article, a simplified method using five chosen indicators is employed to evaluate the level of sustainability. The areas to be evaluated are energy efficiency, use of primary energy, CO2 emissions, costs, and the level of living comfort achieved. The evaluation using these indicators is carried out using three subjective and objective weighting methods, such that the final evaluation includes the viewpoints of an independent evaluator and the points of view of both the user and the state.
   In the case of an assessment of the five indicators for new constructions, it is ensured that the designs for the new building in energy class A have the best total result of the assessment and therefore the best sustainable design, regardless of additional energy, environmental and economic investment during the building phase. With a suitable choice of heat supply, even new buildings in energy class C can come close to the effectiveness of a building design in energy class B.

AB In this study, we analyze holistically the residential energy consumption patterns and the overall housing energy requirements of urban and rural households in Finland. We study separately three of the most common types of housing apartment buildings, row-/terraced houses, and detached houses and include private and the communal building energy as well as the amount of energy consumed by free-time residences. With this study, we add perspective to the ongoing discussion on the sustainability of urban versus rural living and that of different housing types. We employ Household Budget Survey data from Statistics Finland and data from the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) to extract the actual energy purchases and convert them into energy units. Our key findings include five perspectives: (1) behavioral differences seem significant between different housing modes; (2) each housing mode appears to be less energy-intensive in rural areas; (3) including indirect energy purchases is essential when comparing different housing modes; (4) unit-of-analysis (m(2), capita, household) selection strongly affects the results; and (5) the energy mixes vary significantly between the studied building types, changing from the predominance of non-renewables in apartment buildings to that of renewables in detached houses, Which in turn has interesting carbon footprint implications.

TI The use of Passive House Planning Package to reduce energy use and
   CO2 emissions in historic dwellings
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS

AB Since historic buildings constitute 25% of the European built environment they have a role to play in delivering CO2 emissions reduction targets along with the rest of the domestic stock. However, historic buildings have significant cultural value and were built with technologies and materials that promote fabric breathability. This demands solutions that will deliver enduring and radical energy efficiency savings and emissions reduction, which while maintaining their heritage value are also capable of district wide replication.
   Before embarking on wide scale retrofit adaptations, affordable and accurate procedures to assess the potential for such measures to reduce CO2 emissions are of primary importance. Some measures will have an impact on both fabric and aesthetics. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the reductions in CO2 emissions from a set of proposed alterations are significantly higher than any actual or perceived reduction in loss of built heritage.
   This paper demonstrates the use of the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) modelling tool to assess the potential for retrofit adaptation measures in three terrace dwellings in Bath, England. It compares modelled against delivered energy use and then models energy and emission reduction following the introduction of a suite of retrofit adaptations.
   Results indicate that PHPP can assess total electrical energy consumption but requires the use of a reduction factor to reflect accurately intermittent occupancy/heating patterns. The modelled results suggest retrofit adaptations in historic buildings could deliver energy savings and CO2 emissions savings between 55% and 83%, but only when the thermal fabric is significantly improved and the use of PV is included.
   PHPP provided assessments of the benefits of retrofit adaptations in historic buildings that can facilitate decision making on retrofit methodology in historic buildings that affect fabric and/or aesthetics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A thermodynamic calculation model, building envelope exergy cost of unit construction area, which combines the economic and energy efficiency of building envelope and cooling and heating resource, is proposed in the paper to evaluate the building integrated energy efficiency. The model is found on "counterbalance of load" and the building life cycle is also considered. The model is applied to analyze typical building envelopes of the case to decide which one is the best. An office building with 3 building envelope energy efficiency retrofit schemes is applied as the case. The building envelope exergy cost of unit construction area, energy consumption, exergy consumption and CO2 emission of the 4 cases are all analyzed to determine the performance of the retrofit schemes. The results show that the building envelope with good insulation can help to reduce energy demand for cooling and heating. The building envelope energy efficiency retrofit schemes would reduce the building's energy consumption and CO2 emission but it would increase its exergy consumption during its life-cycle. Taking energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, building envelope exergy cost of unit construction area and CO2 emission into consideration, an optimization algorithm for the building envelope energy efficiency retrofit is brought forward.

AB The performance of our cities in terms of how they deal with energy across a wide range of indicators is the key factor in reducing carbon emissions. The focus of this paper is a precinct in Perth which is about to be redeveloped. The proposed plan is modelled looking specifically at Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from: materials used in the construction, not only of the buildings but also the infrastructure (i.e. roads and paving in the public realm); electricity and gas consumption through the use of everyday residential and commercial appliances and equipment; the energy required for the pumping and treatment of water supplied to the development site including water required for the irrigation of public areas as well as for individual consumption; and private motor vehicles owned by residents on the development site. A baseline model representing the proposed plan built to existing codes and standards is used to determine the impact of a range of low-carbon interventions proposed for the development, including reducing parking and adding good quality public transport. Significant GHG emissions reductions of greater than 50% are possible at quite minimal additional cost due to the alternative systems of development that are found to be effective at a precinct scale. In order to achieve such precinct-scale innovations there are policy and regulatory barriers for electricity, thermal energy and water utility providers to overcome. There needs to be a reasonable business case for developers, energy service companies (ESCO's) and potential customers to enable investment in low carbon, precinct scale options. Some examples of these are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lightweight aggregate concrete blocks are being increasingly demanded for construction purposes. These materials, whose principal purpose of their use is to retard the flow of heat, have many other important benefits over normal concrete blocks. Some of these benefits consist of less dead weight of structure, fire resistance, and more endurance against weathering conditions of the environment; therefore, due to high thermal resistance of them, there is a growing tendency in their use in many cold climate zones, especially in earthquake-prone areas. To describe thermal phenomenon through the walls, dynamic thermal circuit modeling was applied in this process. Heat-insulating properties of lightweight concrete blocks were studied by means of thermal resistance parameter. Thermal mass, as another parameter, was investigated for energy-efficient building design. The conduction, convection, and radiation of heat transfer phenomena are being taken into account in this investigation. The abundance of volcanic pumice in the East Azarbaijan Province of Iran is believed to be a remarkable source of lightweight material to produce lightweight aggregate concrete blocks sized 0.2 m x 0.2 m (variable) x 0.4 m, with two equal cavities. East Azarbaijan with its harsh winter weathering conditions was selected for practical data inputs. To obtain realistic results, a typical house of 100 m(2) in area was chosen for heat loss calculation and economic studies. Ratio of heat loss through external walls constructed with lightweight aggregate concrete blocks to that of the ones using normal concrete blocks for the same condition would be less than 0.35 that shows high potential of energy saving for heating. Furthermore, during a winter month, gas consumption, CO2 emission, and living expenses could be decreased as much as 700 kg, 1,925 kg, 625,990 IRR, respectively. Therefore, using lightweight concrete could be economically beneficial, environmentally favorable, and suitable for earthquake-prone areas.

AB Energy consumption in residential buildings is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. Most of the efforts to minimize these emissions contemplate on construction of new high performance green buildings rather than retrofitting the existing residential building stock, which has the greatest emission reduction potential. In this paper, rapidly increasing GHG emissions trend associated with the U.S. residential building stock is addressed. The objective is to reduce or stabilize the increasing GHG emissions trend as a result of sprawling residential building stock across the country. System Dynamics (SD) is utilized to study the mid and long term impacts of green building related policies on the GHG emissions stock. SD model is built based on stock and flow diagram, which is derived from causal loop diagram that consists of 12 endogenous and 2 exogenous variables and causal relationships. Three important action areas are considered for policy making, namely: high performance green building construction, building retrofitting, and net zero building construction. From the three policy fields, a total of 19 policy strategies (7 single and 12 hybrid) is developed and the impacts of the policies on GHG emissions trend are experimented until 2050. Among the proposed policies, retrofitting-focused policies are found to be more effective on stabilizing the GHG emissions trend compared to the policies related to the construction of new net zero and high performance green buildings. On the other hand, hybrid implementation of policies from the three policy fields provided the greatest reduction in the GHG emissions trend. One of the most important outcomes of this study is that focusing on increasing the construction rate of net zero or high performance green buildings alone does not help with stabilizing/reducing the GHG emissions trend unless the retrofitting of existing residential building stock is seriously considered as a strict policy along with green building policies. Analysis results also revealed that the residential green building movement itself is found to be far from being the driver policy in stabilizing the rapidly increasing GHG emissions trend in the long run.

AB To assess cool-roof benefits, the temperatures, heat flows, and energy uses in two similar single-family, single-story homes built side by side in Fresno, California were measured for a year. The "cool" house had a reflective cool concrete tile roof (initial albedo 0.51) with above-sheathing ventilation, and nearly twice the thermal capacitance of the standard dark asphalt shingle roof (initial albedo 0.07) on the "standard" house.
   Cool-roof energy savings in the cooling and heating seasons were computed two ways. Method A divides by HVAC efficiency the difference (standard cool) in ceiling + duct heat gain. Method B measures the difference in HVAC energy use, corrected for differences in plug and window heat gains.
   Based on the more conservative Method B, annual cooling (compressor + fan), heating fuel, and heating fan site energy savings per unit ceiling area were 2.82 kWh/m(2) (26%), 1.13 kWh/m(2) (4%), and 0.0294 kWh/m(2) (3%), respectively. Annual space conditioning (heating + cooling) source energy savings were 10.7 kWh/m(2) (15%); annual energy cost savings were $0.886/m(2) (20%). Annual conditioning CO2, NOx, and SO2 emission reductions were 1.63 kg/m(2) (15%), 0.621 g/m(2) (10%), and 0.0462 g/m(2) (22%). Peak-hour cooling power demand reduction was 0.88 W/m(2) (37%).

AB In this paper, an attempt has been made to implement the concept of daylighting to conserve conventional fuel in a building known as SODHA BERS COMPLEX (SBC) at Varanasi, UP, India. The performance has been analyzed in the context of energy conservation. The building SBC is designed to provide sufficient daylighting, ventilation, as well as thermal comfort to occupants with optimum use of available space for a residential area. The two uppermost rooms of the building have been studied under clear sky conditions. It has been observed that (i) over the lifetime of the building an average energy saving from daylighting is found to be 7933kW h, which corresponds to 16.18 tons of CO2 mitigation, and (ii) an energy payback time, energy production factor, and life cycle conversion efficiency of SBC are observed to be 5.5 yr, 9.09, and 0.17, respectively.

   building stock to achieve a 50% operational energy reduction

AB Mitigating climate change through operational energy reduction in existing buildings is of highest priority for policy-makers in Europe and elsewhere. At the same time there is increasing understanding of the significance of impacts arising from material production for buildings. The aim of this work has therefore been to evaluate the importance of embodied GWP for refurbishment for operational energy reduction on a stockwide basis. It is further intended to judge the relative significance of embodied GWP for specific refurbishment measures implemented for operational energy reduction. We study the case of operational energy reduction in the Swedish residential building stock by 50% compared to 1995.
   The total embodied GWP to achieve the noted operational energy reduction is 0.35 Mt CO2-e/year. 83% of this total is due to ventilation and window measures alone. Compared with previous studies assessing GWP mitigation from operational energy reduction, the "GWP payback time" is just over 3 years.
   Many types of measure that contribute significantly to achieving the above operational energy goal had average embodied GWP between 10 and 20 g CO2-e/kW h operational energy reduction, notably window and ventilation measures. Indoor temperature reduction (to 20 degrees C), was also significant for stockwide operational energy reduction but had a very low GWP of 0.4 g CO2-e/kW h operational energy reduction. If this measure proves unfeasible to implement on a stockwide basis then more expensive measures with higher embodied GWP will be needed to achieve the stated energy reduction goal.

TI Designers' enactment of the policy intentions. An ethnographic study of
   the adoption of energy regulations in England and Wales
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Energy regulations; Low carbon performance; Design process; Building
   design; Ethnographic research
ID BARRIERS
AB The United Kingdom is aspiring to reduce the carbon emissions in the building sector, aiming to achieve nearly zero carbon buildings by 2020. The policy models in England and Wales rely on three strands: regulations; financial incentives and educational schemes. A growing body of literature suggests that the building industry is facing several barriers that hinder the delivery of the expected carbon targets outlined at policy level. This research explores the enactment of the policy aspirations by building designers using a bottom-up approach. An ethnographic study was conducted to analyse the design process of six non-domestic buildings. The work identified the designers' responses to adopt the policy agenda in routine design and overcome the challenges that emerged during the design process. The understanding of the designers' responses could inform the policy model and suggest areas that need attention for the timely delivery of the expected carbon reductions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper outlines the contributions of social science to the study of interactions between urbanization patterns and processes and the carbon cycle, and identifies gaps in knowledge and priority areas for future social scientific research contributions. While previously studied as a unidimensional process, we conceptualize urbanization as a multidimensional, social and biophysical process driven by continuous changes across space and time in various subsystems including biophysical, built environment, and socio-institutional (e.g., economic, political, demographic, behavioral, and sociological). We review research trends and findings focused on the socio-institutional subsystem of the urbanization process, and particularly the dynamics, relationships, and predictions relevant to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Our findings suggest that a multidimensional perspective of urbanization facilitates a wider spectrum of research relevant to carbon cycle dynamics, even within the socio-institutional subsystem. However, there is little consensus around the details and mechanisms underlying the relationship between urban socio-institutional subsystems and the carbon cycle. We argue that progress in understanding the relationship between urbanization and the carbon cycle may be achieved if social scientists work collaboratively with each other as well as with scientists from other disciplines. From this review, we identify research priorities where collaborative social scientific efforts are necessary in conjunction with other disciplinary approaches to generate a more complete understanding of urbanization as a process and its relationship to the carbon cycle.

AB The performance, monitored over 2 years, of side by side detached Welsh Passive is presented. The houses which differ in terms of glazed area, the use of thermal stores, area of installed PV and occupant behaviour provide a valuable insight into different strategies to achieve low and near zero low carbon performance in social housing. Dwelling 1 and Dwelling 2 achieved average net annual carbon emissions of 9.4 kg/m(2), 24.0 kg/m(2), approximately 13%, 33% of a typical "building stock" UK house. The risk of summer time overheating in the dwellings which different glazed areas is analysed in depth. Dwelling I certified to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6 did not achieve true onsite zero carbon performance, the installed PV systems in each dwelling would need to be approximately 6 kW peak to meet this target. Occupant electricity consumption behaviour and appliance choices have a great impact on the energy performance of the houses. With current carbon intensities electricity consumption in UK passive houses needs to be limited to approximately 30% that of the current UK average household if primary energy and zero energy targets are to be achieved while limiting PV size to below 5 kW peak.

AB Global warming has drawn great attention in recent years because of its large impact on many aspects of the environment and human activities in buildings. One area directly affected by climate change is the energy consumption for heating and cooling. To quantify the impact, this study used the HadCM3 Global Circulation Model (GCM) to generate weather data for future typical meteorological years, such as 2020, 2050, and 2080, for 15 cities in the U.S. based on three CO2 emission scenarios. The method was validated by comparing the projected TMY3 data using HadCM3 with the actual TMY3 data. By morphing method, the weather data was downscaled to hourly data for use in building energy simulations by EnergyPlus. Two types of residential buildings and seven types of commercial buildings were simulated for each of the 15 cities. This paper is the first to systematically study the climate change impact on various types of residential and commercial buildings in all seven climate zones in the U.S. through EnergyPlus simulations and provide weighted averaged results for national-wide building stock. We also identified geographical dependency of the impact of climate change on future energy uses. There would be a net increase in source energy consumption by the 2080s for climate zones 1-4 and net decrease in climate zones 6-7 based on the HadCM3 weather projection. Furthermore, this paper investigated natural ventilation performance in San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle with improved natural ventilation model. We found that by the 2080s passive cooling would not be suitable for San Diego because of global warming, but it would still be acceptable for San Francisco and Seattle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Independent lines of research on urbanization, urban areas, and carbon have advanced our understanding of some of the processes through which energy and land uses affect carbon. This synthesis integrates some of these diverse viewpoints as a first step toward a coproduced, integrated framework for understanding urbanization, urban areas, and their relationships to carbon. It suggests the need for approaches that complement and combine the plethora of existing insights into interdisciplinary explorations of how different urbanization processes, and socio-ecological and technological components of urban areas, affect the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon emissions, differentially over time and within and across cities. It also calls for a more holistic approach to examining the carbon implications of urbanization and urban areas, based not only on demographics or income but also on other interconnected features of urban development pathways such as urban form, economic function, economic-growth policies, and other governance arrangements. It points to a wide array of uncertainties around the urbanization processes, their interactions with urban socio-institutional and built environment systems, and how these impact the exchange of carbon flows within and outside urban areas. We must also understand in turn how carbon feedbacks, including carbon impacts and potential impacts of climate change, can affect urbanization processes. Finally, the paper explores options, barriers, and limits to transitioning cities to low-carbon trajectories, and suggests the development of an end-to-end, coproduced and integrated scientific understanding that can more effectively inform the navigation of transitional journeys and the avoidance of obstacles along the way.

AB A consequential-based lifecycle approach is used here to explore the carbon implications of conventional and low-energy versions of three timber multi-storey building systems. The building systems are made of massive wood using cross laminated timber (CLT) elements; beam-and-column using glulam and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) elements; and prefabricated modules using light-frame volume elements. The analysis encompasses the entire resource chains during the lifecycle of the buildings, and tracks the flows of carbon from fossil energy, industrial process reactions, changes in carbon stocks in materials, and potential avoided fossil emissions from substitution of fossil energy by woody residues. The results show that the low-energy version of the CLT building gives the lowest lifecycle carbon emission while the conventional version of the beam-and-column building gives the highest lifecycle emission. Compared to the conventional designs, the low-energy designs reduce the total carbon emissions (excluding from tap water heating and household and facility electricity) by 9%, 8% and 9% for the CLT, beam-and-column and modular systems, respectively, for a 50-year lifespan located in Vaxjo. The relative significance of the construction materials to the fossil carbon emission varies for the different energy-efficiency levels of the buildings, with insulation dominating for the low-energy houses and plasterboard dominating for the conventional houses.

AB Traditional air conditioning and heating systems in buildings are fossil fuel based energy systems, which take the main responsible for the carbon emissions. In contrast, using solar energy for air conditioning becomes one of the promising approaches to reduce energy consumptions and negative environmental impacts from buildings. University of California, Merced built a test facility to investigate the technology: solar cooling. The solar system has 54 m(2) external compound parabolic concentrator (XCPC) solar collectors to drive a 23 kW double-effect absorption chiller. This paper first provides the detailed energy performance analysis of the experiments conducted in August, 2012. The data collected from the experiments shows that the system could provide adequate cooling for a test facility between 11AM to 5PM in both sunny and cloudy days. The daily average collector efficiency is at the range of 36% to 39%. The average coefficient of performance (COP) of the LiBr absorption chiller is between 0.91 and 1.02 with an average of 1.0, and the daily solar COP is approximately at 0.374.
   In addition to the experimental investigation, a detailed life cycle economic and environmental assessment was also performed by comparing the solar systems to the conventional systems in two types of office buildings at three locations at California. Two different solar cooling system configurations were considered: (i) configuration 1 sizes the area of solar collectors and absorption chiller to meet the peak cooling demand, and uses natural gas as the only backup energy source; (ii) configuration 2 sizes the area of solar collectors and absorption chiller to meet half of the peak cooling demand, and uses natural gas as the backup energy source for the absorption chiller, while incorporates an electrical vapor compression chiller to meet the rest half of peak cooling demand. The annual performance predicts that the systems can achieve the annual solar fraction around 55-68%. And the configuration 2 achieves better life cycle economic and environmental performance than the configuration 1. Specifically, the configuration 2 can achieve lower present worth cost during the entire life span than the conventional systems. And both configuration 1 and 2 can reduce the life time carbon footprint by 35-70%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Built environment consumes the bulk of the UK's fossil fuel. Schools account for 15% of the public sector's carbon emissions. Energy efficient building design can play a vital role in achieving the national carbon emission reduction target of 80% by 2050. Natural and mixed mode ventilation is at the forefront of suggested energy efficient strategies for reducing carbon emissions from schools while maintaining good indoor air quality and thermal comfort. However, it is challenging to naturally ventilate many urban school buildings through side openings because of high noise and particulate air pollution. An alternative strategy, such as multi floor operation of windcatchers was assessed in this research as a sole source of fresh air in teaching spaces. Dynamic thermal simulation (DTS) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations assessed the performance of the adopted natural ventilation (NV) strategy in meeting the approved requirements for fresh air, indoor air quality (IAQ) and summertime overheating. Simulation results show that it is challenging to meet approved guidelines on air quality and thermal comfort, only when windcatchers are employed for ventilation purpose. However, fan assisted ventilation in conjunction with windcatchers provided satisfactory results. Detailed performance assessments using CFD seem desirable to validate DTS based findings.

   retrofit using building sensor data

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PERFORMANCE
AB Retrofit measures are an effective means to improve both the heating energy and carbon footprint of a building. On one hand, reducing the losses through the envelope reduces the energy consumption. On the other hand, updating the heating from a fossil-fuel based system to an emission-free one bears the potential for CO2-emission free operation. The latter can be achieved if the supply temperature of the heating system can be sufficiently reduced, such that the operation of a heat pump with a high coefficient of performance becomes feasible. For this, typically the heating area is increased to facilitate the heat transfer. Qualitatively, it is understood that increasing the heating area and improving the insulation of the envelope allows one to lower the supply temperature. However, it is unclear how these improvements relate to each other, or what their individual or combined effect is. In this research, we present a steady-state model to illustrate the impact of retrofit measures on the supply temperature. The model requires the determination of two dimensionless parameters, as well as an estimate for the thermal transmittance (U-value) of the envelope. For this, we developed a flexible, low-cost sensor network. We apply our model to a real retrofit scenario of a historically listed building in Zurich, Switzerland, and show that the current state of the building is already suitable for a low temperature heating system. The findings of our model are confirmed by a calibrated dynamic building simulation. The proposed model provides a means to relate energy savings to reduction of green house gases, and, thus to reduce the CO2 footprint of the building stock. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper presents a calculation and visualization approach for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from residential stock. The used calculation method is based on a bottom-up approach and is implemented in a case district. The visualization of the energy and emission results employs geographical information system (GIS) techniques. We show two examples of how impacts of behavioral and technical changes in the building stock can be assessed and visualized by using the approach. The results obtained provide meaningful and detailed information about the energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions of the residential stock. The information can be, for instance, used in various hot spot analyses. Additionally, the impacts Of energy efficiency measures and behavioral changes can be assessed. These types of analysis can be useful for policy makers in order to prioritize actions cost efficiently, such as carrying out renovations in the residential sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The work addresses the role of local energy planning for the introduction of low carbon policies to achieve challenging climate targets. Taking as reference case an urban area that aims to become Sustainable Community, several initiatives have been assessed. Two target years, 2020 and 2050, have been analysed with the aid of Energy Plan, an integrated energy system model based on the hourly energy demand and supply able to consider constraints deriving from grid stability. The effects of climate change, defined by a regional climate model, have been analysed in the long-term scenario. The work focuses on the impact of a high share of micro-generation technologies for satisfying the energy demand of the building sector, following an original comprehensive approach that helps a better understanding of the implication of such low carbon policy. Both solar devices and micro-combined heat and power systems have been taken into account, the latter covering different technologies (i.e. internal combustion engines, Stirling engines, microturbines and fuel cells). Results show that the use of a high share of micro-generation technologies can help to reduce CO2 emissions and enable an increase in large-scale intermittent renewable production, only if a coordinated local energy plan combined with an optimal operation strategy is pursued. Moreover the work outlines the importance of developing an integrated energy system for introducing such technologies that can help to: (i) decarbonise the building sector, (ii) increase energy security and iii) postpone the investments in new network capacity.

AB The UK government heat strategy is partially based on decarbonisation pathways from the UK MARKAL energy system model. We review how heat provision is represented in UK MARKAL, identifying a number of shortcomings and areas for improvement. We present a completely revised model with improved estimations of future heat demands and a consistent representation of all heat generation technologies. This model represents all heat delivery infrastructure for the first time and uses dynamic growth constraints to improve the modelling of transitions according to innovation theory. Our revised model incorporates a simplified housing stock model, which is used produce highly-refined decarbonisation pathways for residential heat provision. We compare this disaggregated model against an aggregated equivalent, which is similar to the existing approach in UK MARKAL. Disaggregating does not greatly change the total residential fuel consumption in two scenarios, so the benefits of disaggregation will likely be limited if the focus of a study is elsewhere. Yet for studies of residential heat, disaggregation enables us to vary consumer behaviour and government policies on different house types, as well as highlighting different technology trends across the stock, in comparison with previous aggregated versions of the model.

AB Urban heat island effects are already known for decades to result in increased urban outdoor temperatures as compared to the surrounding countryside.
   At the same time, recent years have witnessed growing concern about climate change's impact upon office buildings' performance in regard to indoor thermal comfort and the energy consumption needed to safeguard this comfort.
   Thus, it has to be expected that buildings in urban areas are especially effected by increased outdoor temperatures and the effects these may cause for indoor thermal comfort.
   A vicious circle of raising outdoor temperatures and consequently increasing CO2 emissions associated with raising energy demands for cooling during summer heat waves is anticipated in this respect.
   This paper builds upon regionally downscaled weather data from future climate scenarios and applies these to dynamic thermal simulation of four sample office buildings in Vienna, Austria, at urban locations ranging from central business district to green outskirts of the city. Values of both heating and cooling demands under current and future conditions are calculated: while heating demands slightly diminish, cooling requirements generally rise significantly. Distinct differences in energy performance of buildings from different periods of construction can be observed. The impact of location within the city is considerable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reducing carbon emissions from buildings is vital to achieve goals for avoiding dangerous climate change, and supplying them with low-carbon heat is essential. In the UK, the development of heat networks for supplying low-carbon heat is being encouraged for urban areas where there is high heat demand density. This paper investigates heat demand variability, the role of heat networks and combined heat and power (CHP) in satisfying this demand, and finally the advantages of using heat storage in the system.
   Building heat demands from 50 buildings were analysed at a half-hour resolution with modelling to determine CHP operation patterns with and without heat storage. Daily total heat demand was found to vary from 25% of the full-year average in summer months up to 235% of the average on the coldest days in winter. The heat demand was shown to correlate to outdoor temperatures measured with the degree-day parameter, except for approximately 100 days during the warmest part of the year falling outside the heating season. Sharp spikes in heat demand were seen at the half-hourly time scale coinciding with the switching on of heating systems in some buildings with consequences for building energy supply options.
   It was shown that for an annual heat demand of 40,000 MW h, the use of thermal storage can significantly increase the running time of a CHP energy centre with 4 MW capacity designed to supply this demand. The cost savings resulting from increased on-site heat and electricity production resulted in a payback period for heat storage investment of under four years with further benefits if it can assist other heat sources on the heat network. Environmental advantages of using heat storage included further carbon dioxide emission reductions of 1000-1500 tonnes per year depending upon the CHP configuration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is a win win technology to inject CO2 into the oil or gas reservoirs. Because it can reduce the greenhouse gas emission and enhance oil recovery. In some oil or gas reservoirs, the reservoir water and the strong heterogeneity make the CO2 storage capacity difficult to be determined. In this research, the CO2 storage evaluation method is introduced. This method considers the CO2 displacement efficiency, the CO2 sweep efficiency, the CO2 dissolution in oil and gas and the CO2 displacement mechanism. The key factors in this evaluation method are determined by the reservoir simulation method, the thermodynamic theories and the statistical analysis methods separately. At last, the CO2 storage capacity evaluation system is built. This system can be used to evaluate the CO2 storage capacity fast and reliably and it worth to be promoted in the area of CO2 storage.

AB The aim of this paper is to show the environmental benefits provided by the Multilayer Structural Panels technology when applied to construct low rise residential buildings.
   This is a holistic approach that takes into account the structural aspects and the environmental issues involved. Conclusions are based on the assessment of a broad set of cases and a procedure is provided to compare the environmental impact of each one. The design space was composed of single-family houses with three different building technologies: Reinforced Concrete Multilayer Structural Panels solving, at the same time and with high level of efficiency, structural and thermal insulation requirements; Reinforced Concrete Frame structures combined with insulated cavity walls; and Steel Frames structures plus insulated cavity walls. An optimized structural analysis was applied to fulfil the load transfer requirements. On each case were evaluated the economic cost, the embodied energy and the amount of CO2 emissions during the construction phase and also the energy savings obtained along the use phase of the building due to the reduction in heat losses. The conclusions show that the more substantial improvements can be achieved when buildings are located on intense seismic activity areas or places with poor bearing capacity soils.

AB The UK's housing stock generates approximately 27% of the country's total annual carbon emissions. In light of the legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions, new housing is subject to a tightening of regulations governing energy demand and efficiency resulting in a gradual improvement in carbon emissions. The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the 'Green Deal'. There has however been little consideration of the 18% of UK households who privately rent their home, a tenure that is growing fast. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that influence private sector landlords when considering energy efficiency improvements to their tenanted homes. The results indicate that government policy has consistently failed to engage private sector landlords in the issue of energy efficiency and thus measures must be taken to understand the motivations of landlords in order to design effective incentives and interventions.

AB This synthesis article presents an overview of an urban metabolism (UM) approach using mixed methods and multiple sources of data for Los Angeles, California. We examine electric energy use in buildings and greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, and calculate embedded infrastructure life cycle effects, water use and solid waste streams in an attempt to better understand the urban flows and sinks in the Los Angeles region (city and county). This quantification is being conducted to help policy-makers better target energy conservation and efficiency programs, pinpoint best locations for distributed solar generation, and support the development of policies for greater environmental sustainability. It provides a framework to which many more UM flows can be added to create greater understanding of the study area's resource dependencies. Going forward, together with policy analysis, UM can help untangle the complex intertwined resource dependencies that cities must address as they attempt to increase their environmental sustainability.

AB This article examines an important class of information system that serves as the foundation for corporate energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting: energy and carbon management systems (ECMS). Investors, regulators, customers, and employees increasingly demand that organizations provide information about their organizational energy use and GHG emissions. However, there is little transparency about how organizations use ECMS to meet such demands. To shed light on ECMS implementation and application, we collected extensive qualitative interview data from two service-sector organizations: one that uses a spreadsheet-based ECMS and another that implemented an ECMS provided by a third-party vendor. Our analysis of collected data revealed numerous challenges in the areas of business processes, managerial capabilities, data capture and integration, and data quality. Though our study is built on only two organizations and requires confirmation in large-sample surveys, we provide several recommendations for organizations regarding ECMS. We also provide suggestions for future studies to build on our tentative results.

TI Recycling concrete in practice - a chance for sustainable resource
   management
SO STRUCTURAL CONCRETE

DE recycled concrete; grey energy; sustainable construction; building
   materials; resource management; life cycle assessment
AB Private households consume about 30 % of Germany's total primary energy and cause about 15 % of the total CO2 emissions, and so this sector represents a key sector for climate protection targets. Whereas primary energy consumption in buildings is limited by regulations, the production of carbon emissions-intensive materials is only moving slowly into the focus of legislation, regulations and, ultimately, the perception of society. Considering a thermally conditioned building during its life cycle, most environmental effects are during operation. Nevertheless, the grey energy of a concrete structure can add up to 20 % in individual cases. Owing to the carbon-intensive cement production, concrete as a material causes relatively high environmental impacts. Logical options appear to be substituting cement with so called by-products or using recycled additives. In fact, there are only a few projects that have used a resource-saving concrete. In 2010 in Ludwigshafen, one building in a group of buildings was chosen as the first building in Germany to be built almost completely from recycled concrete without increasing the cement content. It was built as a low-energy construction and in a zero-carbon-emissions area. The project was supported scientifically by the Institute of Energy and Environmental Research in Heidelberg and the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus. The buildings won the Construction Prize 2011 with the distinction "best relation between quality and costs". This paper discusses integral aspects of the use of recycling concrete from the structural design, eco-accounting and materials properties perspectives. It demonstrates the potential and opportunities for the quality-assured use of recycling concrete for sustainable resource management.

AB This paper considers energy conservation practices in Qatar with special emphasis on commercial buildings. Energy conservation approaches are classified into five main areas and an Energy Conservation Matrix (ECM) database for buildings is developed. The ECM maps the energy conservation techniques/technologies to models versus their application domain. Three scenarios (building envelope design, change in customer behavior, and consideration of renewable energy supply) are analyzed to study different alternatives for efficiency improvement. The analysis is done in a case hotel. The analysis shows that, the energy conservation potential of using envelope redesign for the case study is about 7.5% while conservation through behavior change ranges between 2.74% and 15.80%. The conserved energy potential ranges between 10% and 24.12% of the site energy in the combinatorial scenario that integrated envelope design alternatives with customer behavior change. The renewable energy (RE) scenario conserves energy, indirectly, by using green energies generated from renewable sources. The output shows that due to changes as per the three scenarios, total CO2 emissions of the building are also reduced. The analysis shows that adoption of 30% RE alternative can reduce emissions by about 27% with respect to the reference scenario. It is believed that the scenarios developed in this paper and the results obtained will motivate the designers to consider alternative designs or redesigns in the large scale commercial buildings.

AB The large industrialization in 70s and 80s provoked a transfer of population from the rural areas to cities. Especially in the communist countries, massive multi-storey buildings were erected, supplied by a district heating grid with big power plants. Nowadays the maintenance of such big systems is big-energy consuming and refurbishment is very hard to accomplish and therefore, in many situations, district heating is no longer profitable. We present in this paper an integrated system for local district heating, aiming to substitute the old and inefficient district system for a condominium, located in the city of Bucharest, Romania. The main paper objective is to demonstrate that the energy performance of the connected buildings could be significantly improved by changing the heat source. With CHP-HP-HT-ATES technology, initially D-energy class buildings (according to the Romanian methodology of calculation of buildings performance-Mc 001/2006) can switch to B-energy class. Moreover, the refurbishment of the buildings envelopes will help the envisaged condominium to approach the nZEB characteristics of energy consumption. A comparison between several heat production systems, in terms of primary energy and CO2 emissions is also provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cascade Impactor is a powerful sampling method to collect airborne particles as a function of their size. The 3-stages Cascade Impactor used in this study allowed to sample simultaneously particles with aerodynamic diameter D-ae > 10 mu m, 2.5 mu m < D-ae < 10 mu m, 1 mu m < D-ae < 2.5 mu m and D-ae < 1 mu m. Once collected individual concentrations of the 16 US-EPA priority Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) bound to particles were quantified for 8 different indoor environments located in Strasbourg area in France. All the heavy PAHs owning between 4 and 6 aromatic rings were detected in all of the 8 sampling sites. The total PAHs concentration varied from 0.44 to 2.09 ng m(-3) for a low-energy building school and a smoking apartment, respectively. Results revealed also that high molecular weight PAHs were mainly associated to the finest particles. Our data are consistent with those measured elsewhere in European indoor environments.

AB This research study investigates the effects of the large-scale installation of domestic heat pumps on the UK electricity supply over the short to medium term. A BREDEM-based dwelling energy model, incorporating a model of heat pump performance, is enhanced for the effects of varying monthly temperatures. Data from the English Housing Survey (2007) are analysed using this model to estimate electricity consumption to 2020 and 2050, and simulate scenarios for replacing existing heating systems by ground or air source heat pumps. The type of heat pump (ground or air source) is determined by dwelling plot dimensions data from the EHS. Modelling results for 2020 showed that a policy of replacing the heating systems with the highest emissions could reduce or at least minimise the increase in electricity consumption and carbon emissions. Results for 2050 showed that replacement of some 80% of current gas-fired systems would enable the UK to meet its target of 80% carbon emissions reduction in this sector when accompanied by simultaneous decarbonisation of the electricity supply. These results provide some support for the UK government's policy of subsidizing heat pump installations through the Renewable Heat Incentive payments while indicating that meeting emission targets requires far greater adoption of these systems than current ambitions.

AB This paper aims to integrate decentralized energy systems ilia village in Switzerland, which has the goal to phase out fossil fuels and rely on local renewable energy sources. To reach this ambitious target, a revision of the current energy system is required together with retrofitting of the building stock. The method applied is based on the energy hub concept, which can be used to optimize the energy consumption during planning and operation. To apply the energy hub concept at neighbourhood level, a three step approach is required, including modelling the energy demand of the buildings, the evaluation of the local renewable potential, and the management and optimization of demand and supply. Centralized and decentralized local renewable sources are investigated, namely photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power. Scenarios are evaluated based on their environmental performance and savings of CO2 emissions. Results show that an energy sustainability (ratio of energy demand covered by renewables) of 83% and a CO2 emissions reduction of 86% can be achieved. The results further suggest that up to 50% of the available energy potential from renewables cannot be utilized in this community when insufficient storage is provided in the energy system.

AB Rapid economic development induces energy shortage and environmental pollution, and the utilization of renewable energy becomes a hot topic. Taking the tidal energy in Shanghai as a research object, this article analyzes the reserves, potential developing mode, and potential capacity on the basis of observation data for 18 years. The results show that the tidal energy resources are abundant in Shanghai's sea area of China. Through tidal range analysis and tidal energy reserves calculation, the tidal barrage can be built to explore the tidal energy from the water head difference between the flood tide and the ebb in the north branch of Yangtze River Estuary, while the tidal turbines can be built to generate electricity in the Northern Hangzhou Bay. The tidal energy reserve is 3.65 million kW per year in Shanghai's sea area of China. The annual electricity generating capacity is 10.07 billion kWh, which is equivalent to 3.63 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 3.72% of Shanghai energy consumption in 2007. It can also reduce 9.50 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, 30.8 thousand tons of sulfur dioxide emissions, and 26.8 thousand tons of nitrogen oxides emissions. The utilization of tidal energy is an effective method to solve environmental problems and energy issues.

DE green roof retrofitting; Sydney; Rio de Janeiro; thermal performance;
   residential buildings; housing; case studies
AB The built environment contributes around half of total greenhouse gas emissions and with 87% of residential buildings that we will have by 2050 already built, it is vital to adopt sustainable retrofitting practices. The question is: what are the viable solutions? One answer may be green roof retrofitting. The environmental benefits include reduced operational carbon emissions, reduced urban heat island effect, increased bio-diversity, housing temperature attenuation and reduced stormwater run-off. The economic benefits are the reduced maintenance costs and lower running costs. The social gain is the creation of spaces where people have access to green areas. However, the barriers to retrofitting include the perceptions of structural adequacy, the risk of water damage, high installation and maintenance costs, as well as access and security issues. Many Australian and Brazilian residential buildings have metal sheet roofs, a lightweight material with poor thermal performance. During the summer, temperatures in Sydney and Rio de Janeiro reach 45 degrees Celsius, and in both cities, rainfall patterns are changing, with more intense downpours. Furthermore, many residential buildings are leased, and currently, tenants are restricted by the modifications that they can perform to reduce running costs and carbon emissions. This research reports on an experiment on two small-scale metal roofs in Sydney and Rio de Janeiro to assess the thermal performance of portable small-scale modules. The findings are that considerable variation in temperature was found in both countries, indicating that green roof retrofitting could lower the cooling energy demand considerably.

AB Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) is a cost-effective technology that enables the reduction of energy use and CO2 emissions associated with the heating and cooling of buildings by storage and recovery of large quantities of thermal energy in the subsurface. Reducing the distance between wells in large-scale application of ATES increases the total amount of energy that can be provided by ATES in a given area. However, due to thermal interference the performance of individual systems can decrease. In this study a novel method is presented that can be used to (a) determine the impact of thermal interference on the economic and environmental performance of ATES and (b) optimize well distances in large-scale applications. The method is demonstrated using the hydrogeological conditions of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Results for this case study show that it is cost-effective to allow a limited amount of thermal interference, such that 30-40% more energy can be provided in a given area compared to the case in which all negative thermal interference is avoided. Sensitivity analysis indicates that optimal well distance is moderately insensitive to changes in hydrogeological and economic conditions. Maximum economic benefit compared to conventional heating and cooling systems on the other hand is sensitive, especially to changes in the gas price and storage temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Twenty percent of the total energy consumption in the Netherlands comes from household electricity consumption. This comes from household electric appliances whose number has grown in recent years. The paper explores the effect of smart meter introduction, appliance efficiency and consumer behaviour on reducing electricity consumption in the Netherlands. It does so by combining two perspectives: a sociotechnical approach and a bottom up simulation approach. The range of scenarios explored through simulation in the paper provides an understanding of the interplay between efficiency, smart meter diffusion and consumer behaviour. The results show their effect on electricity consumption and suggest that further effort is required to control and reduce it. Insights from the paper suggest that future studies should disaggregate with respect to a number of factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Selection of building materials in the design process is an important factor influencing not only future functionality of the building but also environmental performance. This paper deals with the environmental analysis of two material alternatives of one conventional Slovak masonry family-house with commonly used material composition in selected structures. Environmental analysis was aimed at the calculation of embodied energy, embodied CO2, and embodied SO2 emissions expressed as primary energy intensity (PEI), global warming potential (GWP), and acidification potential (AP), respectively. Total embodied energy of building materials (PEI) has been calculated to be equal to 780.1 and 698.4 GJ for A1 and A2 alternatives. Average calculated values of environmental parameters reached 2.19 MJ/kg of used materials for PEI; 0.105 kg CO(2)eq/kg for GWP and 0.71 x 10(-3) kg SO(2)eq/kg for AP. Average values of building materials environmental parameters per floor area were calculated of 4,195.925 MJ/m(2) for embodied energy (PEI), 202.5 kg CO(2)eq/m(2) for embodied CO2 emissions (GWP) and 1.36 kg SO(2)eq/m(2) for embodied SO2 emissions (AP). The results of the analysis point to the fact that it is possible to reduce the environmental impacts by up to 61.0 % in particular structures and by up to 10.5 % overall just by a simple change of several building materials in the structures.

AB The residential sector is responsible for approximately a quarter of energy consumption in Europe. This consumption, together with that of other buildings, mainly from the tertiary sector, makes up 40% of total energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions. Artificial lighting makes up 14% of electrical consumption in the European Union and 19% worldwide. Through the use of well-designed natural lighting, controlled by technologies or systems which guarantee accessibility from all areas inside buildings, energy consumption for lighting and air conditioning can be kept to a minimum. The authors of this article carried out a state of the art on the technologies or control systems of natural light in buildings, concentrating on those control methods which not only protect the occupants from direct solar glare but also maximize natural light penetration in buildings based on the occupants' preferences, whilst allowing for a reduction in electrical consumption for lighting and cooling. All of the control and/or natural light guidance systems and/or strategies guarantee the penetration of daylight into the building, thus reducing the electrical energy consumption for lighting and cooling. At the same time they improve the thermal and visual comfort of the users of the buildings. However various studies have also brought to light certain disadvantages to these systems.

AB One of the most cost-effective ways to save energy in commercial buildings is through designing a dedicated controller for adjusting environmental set-points according occupancy flow. This paper presents the design of a fuzzy rule-based supervisory controller for reducing energy consumptions while simultaneously providing comfort for passengers in a large airport terminal building. The inputs to the controller are the time schedule of the arrival and departure of passenger planes as well as the expected number of passengers, zone global illuminance (daylight) and external temperature. The outputs from the controller are optimised temperature, airflow and lighting set-point profiles for the building. The supervisory controller was designed based on expert knowledge in MATLAB/Simulink, and then validated using simulation studies. The simulation results demonstrate significant potential for energy savings in the controller's ability to maintain comfort by adjusting set-points according to the flow of passengers.Practical application: The systematic approach adopted here, including the use of artificial intelligence to design supervisory controllers, can be extended to other large buildings which have variable but predictable occupancy patterns like the restricted area of the airport terminal building.

AB In this study, annual, monthly and hourly ambient temperature distributions are determined and analysed for Karabuk . For each month of the year, variance of outdoor air temperature, monthly and seasonal heating degree hour (HDH) values are calculated according to 11 different indoor reference temperature (18 degrees C to 28 degrees C), and the resulting coefficient of determination indicates high correlation as R-2 = 0.998. By considering HDH values, three kinds of fossil energy resources, (coal, natural gas, fuel-oil), annual unit area fuel needs, amount of carbon-dioxide and sulphur-dioxide. When indoor temperature is chosen 19 degrees C instead of 18 degrees C for coal, annual CO2 emission increases by 8.7%. On the other hand, 24 degrees C indoor temperature, rate of increase reaches to 53.2%. This study is first in the literature to investigate the effect of three kinds of fuel's energy impact on environment in the case of different indoor reference temperature for heating.

DT Article
DE Building energy use; Low carbon; Energy simulation
AB This paper discusses an overall strategy for reducing energy demand in non-domestic buildings, mainly focusing on office developments. It considers four areas: reducing internal heat loads; addressing passive design through the building construction; using efficient and responsive HVAC systems and focusing on chilled (heated) surface systems; integrating renewable energy supply systems into the building design. The impact on energy use and carbon dioxide emissions will be discussed. The paper will draw from a range of design projects carried out in Europe, where this integrated approach has been applied, and then explore the benefits in relation to applications in the Middle East and China. Energy modeling results, to inform the design process will be presented, using energy simulation for three case study locations, in Zurich, the Chongqing and Abu Dhabi.

AB The aim of this paper is twofold: to investigate the applicability of a building-stock modelling methodology to assess the potential of Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) and their associated effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for a building stock in a South European climate, with Spain being used as an example; and to analyse the technical potentials and costs of the ECMs when applied both individually and as packages of multiple ECMs for the entire Spanish building stock, including residential and non-residential buildings. The modelling methodology, which has been designed to be applicable to any European country, is fully dynamic and based on an aggregated description of the building stock. This paper updates and validates the methodology to account for the climate and technical characteristics of the region under study. Applying all ECMs as a package gives a potential technical reduction in final energy demand of 55% and a 65% reduction in CO2 emissions, while the corresponding techno-economical potentials are 33% and 37%. Nevertheless, the market potentials estimated are substantially lower (5-10%), which indicate that policy shifts are needed if the techno-economic potentials identified in this work are to be realized.

DE Life cycle costs; Social housing; Assisted living; Thermal

ID ENERGY DEMAND; IMPACT
AB The existing building stock has an immense impact on preserving a social, economic and ecologic sustainability - especially in Central Europe with low rates of new construction. This paper focuses on lifecycle based renovation strategies considering not only structural and thermal refurbishment, but also the social aspects of an ageing society needs, as well as a preservation of cultural heritage.
   For a case study of a specific housing block of the Red Vienna historic period, several refurbishment variants were developed and evaluated in a quantitative as well as qualitative way for the economic (life cycle costs and yields), ecologic (CO2 emissions) and socio-cultural impacts (monument protection, accessibility, assisted living).
   According to the research, there are great potentials in structural refurbishment of the building stock for support of assisted living models. These prove to be substantially more cost efficient than the institutional care, providing a better comfort for the inhabitants, as well as the necessary social mix by a trans-generation housing in the social housing facilities.

AB Structural-functional integrated materials are one of directions of rapid development for saving-energy materials. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are latent thermal storage materials possessing a large amount of heat energy stored during its phase change stage. Porous lightweight aggregate (LWA) can serve as the carrier for PCM. In this research, a structural concrete with function of indoor temperature control were prepared by using macro encapsulated PCM-LWA. The indoor and outdoor tests were performed to determine the thermal performance of the lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) containing macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA. The compressive strength and shrinkage strain of LWAC with macro encapsulated PCM-LWA were evaluated. Finally, the economic and environmental aspects of application of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in a typical floor area of public housing rental flat in Hong Kong were assessed.
   From indoor thermal performance test, it was found that LWAC incorporated with macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA has a function of reducing the energy consumption by decreasing the indoor temperature; flatten the fluctuation of indoor temperature and shifting the loads away from the peak periods. Moreover, from outdoor thermal performance test, it was found that the performance of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in adjusting the room temperature was optimized when there was a remarkable temperature difference between the day and night. Test results showed that the compressive strengths of LWAC incorporating macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA at 28 days was higher than control LWAC (without macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA) and was found to be over 15 MPa. The shrinkage strain reduced with the incorporation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in LWAC and therefore has a beneficial effect on the volume stability of LWAC. From simple economic evaluation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in a typical floor area of public housing rental flat in Hong Kong, the recovery or payback period was found to be less than the average life span of a residential building in Hong Kong. Therefore, incorporation of macro encapsulated Paraffin-LWA in LWAC building walls is economically feasible. Finally, from environmental prospect, a reduction of 465 kg CO2-eq/year or 12.91 kg CO2-eg/year/m(2) was achieved. This reduction would contribute to mitigate Greenhouse Gases emissions over the life span of building. It can therefore be concluded that the developed macro encapsulated PCM LWAC can be used for thermal and structural applications in buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improving household energy efficiency is regarded as key to significantly curtailing domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Various policy instruments have been introduced to retrofit the existing domestic building stock in the UK; however, many fail to acknowledge the significant role that occupants' lifestyle play in energy use. The research discusses the results of a survey questionnaire administered to the residents of one of the pilot CESP schemes in Aspley, Nottingham. Factors affecting domestic energy consumption are explored, some of which relate to the building design, while others are under the direct control of the occupants. Significant findings related to home performance, home energy use, and tenants' lifestyle are investigated in the first phase of the research. The total number of responses to the survey represents 10% of around 900 properties eligible for the CESP scheme that have not been approached for the scheme uptake. It is evident from the survey results that the majority of the sample is aware of the basic energy-saving actions in everyday life but are not likely to take up the more difficult actions. In summary, retrofit programmes will reduce carbon emissions to some degree, whereas the bigger challenge is addressing habitual household energy consumption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Energy use during the material, transportation and construction phases up to project practical completion is known as initial embodied energy. Contractors have the opportunity to capture initial embodied energy data and influence performance due to their significant involvement in project procurement and delivery. In this case study practical challenges and opportunities were addressed for delivering improved initial embodied energy efficiency during construction. A revised framework was applied to a live industrial warehouse project to assess the initial embodied energy performance of assorted construction activities, packages and sub-contractors. The practices employed by the contractor on-site were explored and then improved. Results show that material phase impacts represented 95.1% of the total initial embodied energy consumption whereby construction packages predominately containing steel and concrete-based materials (i.e. ground and upper floor, external slab and frame) were most significant. The overall initial embodied impact was deemed greater than the operational impact at the end of the buildings 25-year lifespan. Findings suggest that future project benchmarks and targets should be normalised per site area, as these impacts were found to be significant in this particular case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The land-use implications of deep decarbonization of the electricity sector (e.g., 80% below 1990 emissions) have not been well-characterized quantitatively or spatially. We assessed the operational-phase land-use requirements of different low-carbon scenarios for California in 2050 and found that most scenarios have comparable direct land footprints. While the per MWh footprint of renewable energy (RE) generation is initially higher, that of fossil and nuclear generation increases over time with continued fuel use. We built a spatially explicit model to understand the interactions between resource quality and environmental constraints in a high RE scenario (>70% of total generation). We found that there is sufficient land within California to meet the solar and geothermal targets, but areas with the highest quality wind and solar resources also tend to be those with high conservation value. Development of some land with lower conservation value results in lower average capacity factors, but also provides opportunity for colocation of different generation technologies, which could significantly improve land-use efficiency and reduce permitting, leasing, and transmission infrastructure costs. Basing siting decisions on environmentally-constrained long-term RE build-out requirements produces significantly different results, including better conservation outcomes, than implied by the current piecemeal approach to planning.

ID THERMAL COMFORT; EMISSIONS; DEMAND
AB This paper investigates the risk of projected post-2050s overheating in existing, retrofitted and new-build dwellings in the United Kingdom. As shown in the previous research, passive measures may not be sufficient in mitigating overheating risk. Therefore, mechanical cooling technologies that may be deployed to adapt' to a warming climate are tested for energy and CO2 implications. For retrofits, heating demand is projected to remain dominant, whereas in post-2016 new-build, greater cooling system efficiency will be important. Thermal mass is shown to reduce future cooling load. The heat recovery element of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery may be rendered unnecessary in super-efficient homes. Ceiling fans coupled with natural ventilation may be sufficient in providing thermal comfort in the north of England. Ultimately, not planning for future overheating and cooling systems could create a new performance gap in design, construction and occupant behaviour. Practical application: Overheating, already experienced in dwellings throughout the United Kingdom and projected to increase in occurrence, should be considered in all new design and retrofit. Dwellings designed to meet thermal comfort performance targets may be at risk of non-compliance as a result of a warming climate. Furthermore, dwellings designed to meet energy performance targets may be at risk of non-compliance as a result of potential need for cooling systems. The findings have implications for policy-making in relation to decarbonisation of the electricity grid, implementation of the Green Deal and upgrading building regulations to future-proof new and existing housing against a warming climate.

AB Anthropogenic and biogenic controls on the surface atmosphere exchange of CO2 are explored for three different environments. Similarities are seen between suburban and woodland sites during summer, when photosynthesis and respiration determine the diurnal pattern of the CO2 flux. In winter, emissions from human activities dominate urban and suburban fluxes; building emissions increase during cold weather, while traffic is a major component of CO2 emissions all year round. Observed CO2 fluxes reflect diurnal traffic patterns (busy throughout the day (urban); rush-hour peaks (suburban)) and vary between working days and non-working days, except at the woodland site. Suburban vegetation offsets some anthropogenic emissions, but 24-h CO2 fluxes are usually positive even during summer. Observations are compared to estimated emissions from simple models and inventories. Annual CO2 exchanges are significantly different between sites, demonstrating the impacts of increasing urban density (and decreasing vegetation fraction) on the CO2 flux to the atmosphere.

AB A methodology is presented that combines a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and artificial neural networks to optimise single-storey steel commercial buildings for net-zero carbon impact. Both symmetric and asymmetric geometries are considered in conjunction with regulated, unregulated and embodied carbon. Offsetting is achieved through photovoltaic (PV) panels integrated into the roof. Asymmetric geometries can increase the south facing surface area and consequently allow for improved PV energy production. An exemplar carbon and energy breakdown of a retail unit located in Belfast UK with a south facing PV roof is considered. It was found in most cases that regulated energy offsetting can be achieved with symmetric geometries. However, asymmetric geometries were necessary to account for the unregulated and embodied carbon. For buildings where the volume is large due to high eaves, carbon offsetting became increasingly more difficult, and not possible in certain cases. The use of asymmetric geometries was found to allow for lower embodied energy structures with similar carbon performance to symmetrical structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB From the perspectives of the energy and the environment, building stock should be considered a useful resource in the struggle against greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy resources.
   The aim of this work is to provide an example of the application of a methodology to evaluate the energy needs of the building stock of a city and to determine the possible strategies for energy planning.
   This paper aims to obtain an estimate, on an urban scale, of the energy needs and CO2 emissions of the public residential buildings of Bari. This estimate is achieved by evaluating the critical issues of the built heritage, the most common architectural typologies and the heating systems in the territory of the city of Bad in southern Italy, as well as the possible strategies for upgrading energy efficiency, through the combined use of energy software and geo-referenced systems. Furthermore, several possible interventions are assumed to improve the energy performance of buildings in not only environmental terms but also economic terms through the instrument of cost-benefit analysis. The ultimate goal is to compare the different intervention strategies to determine which demonstrate greater cost effectiveness and feasibility for future energy planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rapid urbanization has greatly impacted housing demand and housing development in Iskandar Malaysia, Johor. Iskandar Malaysia vision towards development of a low carbon society and in line with Malaysian government policy promoting industrialized building system (IBS) to meet the increasing housing demand. Hence, a comparative analysis of life cycle analysis (LCA) at assembly phase has been conducted to identify life cycle impact assessment and hotspot for material and construction stage between IBS and conventional cast in situ for residential apartment buildings in Iskandar Malaysia. The purpose is to apply IBS in residential building construction towards greener building and sustainable development. The functional unit of the comparison analyses was one square metre of produced building area for the respective construction period. A comparable inventory analysis will be carried out between two case studies. An input-output flowchart is created for each process to determine the components included in the analysis. Flows of assembly phase will be modelled in Gabi 6.0 software to further interpret the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) between the two construction methods, and to determine the hotspot between the processes. Finally, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted to determine the influence of variations in assumptions, methods and data on the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SYSTEM
AB An experimental study was performed on a prototype model of Earth to Air Heat Exchanger System (EAHE) equipped with low cost material like PVC pipes and exhaust fans made on temporary platform. Emphasis was given on the design of the duct system suitable for small houses without any space in urban and rural areas. Tests were performed to predict the cooling potential and impact of the material on the performance of EAHE system. Experiment was performed continuously for more than three weeks and the result shows that irrespective to the inlet air temperature (ranges from 34A degrees C to 44A degrees C), outlet air temperature was recorded between 20A degrees C to 22A degrees C, which shows the effectiveness of the system. No significant affect of the material used for making the underground air pipe system was recorded on the performance of the model. The Minimum EER (W/W) ratio calculated for the prototype model was around 3.78, which is equivalent to a Energy Star 5 rating, the most efficient system. The weekly energy saving potential of the model before and after integration of EAHE was analyzed i.e., around 5 kWh/week and 20 kWh/week respectively. This considerable increase in weekly energy savings potential of model due to EAHE leads to mitigation of CO2 emissions if implemented in the residential, commercial and industrial buildings and the corresponding annual carbon credit of these buildings can be decreased manifold. The Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis of model also shows that the payback period is around 3 to 4 years for the investment on EAHE system. After a series of experimental analysis the study also reveals that EAHE system is easily and economically feasible technique which can drastically reduce the consumption of energy in future and eliminate the need for conventional compressor based cooling systems.

AB Decarbonization of electricity generation can support climate-change mitigation and presents an opportunity to address pollution resulting from fossil-fuel combustion. Generally, renewable technologies require higher initial investments in infrastructure than fossil-based power systems. To assess the tradeoffs of increased up-front emissions and reduced operational emissions, we present, to our knowledge, the first global, integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) of long-term, wide-scale implementation of electricity generation from renewable sources (i.e., photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, and hydropower) and of carbon dioxide capture and storage for fossil power generation. We compare emissions causing particulate matter exposure, freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and climate change for the climate-change-mitigation (BLUE Map) and business-as-usual (Baseline) scenarios of the International Energy Agency up to 2050. We use a vintage stock model to conduct an LCA of newly installed capacity year-by-year for each region, thus accounting for changes in the energy mix used to manufacture future power plants. Under the Baseline scenario, emissions of air and water pollutants more than double whereas the low-carbon technologies introduced in the BLUE Map scenario allow a doubling of electricity supply while stabilizing or even reducing pollution. Material requirements per unit generation for low-carbon technologies can be higher than for conventional fossil generation: 11-40 times more copper for photovoltaic systems and 6-14 times more iron for wind power plants. However, only two years of current global copper and one year of iron production will suffice to build a low-carbon energy system capable of supplying the world's electricity needs in 2050.

AB A deep three-years survey of the existing social housing stock in Emilia Romagna, Italy, has been completed helping to accomplish a full acknowledgement of more than 70 buildings in terms of both their envelopes and heating system characteristics. Analysing the outcome data, a simplified parametric calculation protocol has been created to operate a preliminary audit and energy retrofit simulation on the entire social housing stock of the Region.
   The results of the study, initial data about the energy state-of-the-art of the building cluster and feasible retrofit solutions, are useful to identify where to focus for a further and more accurate energy diagnosis.
   This paper represents a synthesis of a three-years research work, demonstrating the potential of the parametric assessment method in terms of evaluating environmental and energy benefits, deriving from scheduled retrofit actions, to assist technicians in endeavouring interventions priority.

AB An experimental research with a solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) micro grid feeding a reversible air-water, 6 kW heating capacity heat pump, has been carried out from December 2012 to April 2013. Its purpose is to heat a laboratory that is used as a house prototype for the study of heating/cooling systems. It was built in accordance with the 2013 Spanish CTE, and has an area of 35 m(2) divided into two internal rooms: one of them housing the storage system, the solar controller, the inverter and the control system; the other one is occupied by three people. Its main thermal characteristics are: LIA = 125 W/degrees C and a maximum thermal load about 6.0 kW at the initial time. The PVT field consists of 12 modules, vvith a total area of 15.7 m(2) and useful area of 14 m(2). Each module is composed of 48 polycrystalline silicon cells of 243.4 cm(2), which with a nominal efficiency 14% can generate a power of 180 W, being the total nominal power installed 2.16 kW. The PV system stores electricity in 250 Ah batteries from where is converted from DC to AC through a 3.0 kW inverter that feeds the heat pump. This works supplying 8401/h of hot water at 35-45 degrees C to the radiant floor. The data storing system is recording variables such as solar radiation; temperatures; input power to batteries; heat produced; heat transferred by the radiant floor; heat pump's COP; isolated ratio; and solar fraction. The objective of this work is to present and discuss the experimental results and the emission reduction of CO2 obtained during the period from 01/12/2012 to 30/04/2013, including the detailed results of two representative days of Madrid's climate: 28/12/2012 using only PV electricity and 21/01/2013 mixing PV and conventional electricity.

AB Based on the logical causal relationship and taking Liaoning Province, China, which is the Chinese traditional industrial base and is in the stage of accelerated urbanisation, as a case study, this study builds the 'Urbanisation-Energy Consumption-CO2 Emissions System Dynamics (UEC-SD)' model using a system dynamics method. The UEC-SD model is applied to analyse the effect of the urbanisation process on the regional energy structure and CO2 emissions, followed by simulation of future production and living energy consumption structure as well as the evolutionary trend of CO2 emissions of three urbanisation scenarios (low speed, intermediate speed and high speed) under the assumed boundary conditions in urban and rural areas of Liaoning Province, China. The results show that the urbanisation process can alter production and the living energy consumption structure and thereby change regional CO2 emissions. An increase in the urbanisation rate in case area will lead to regional CO2 emissions rising in the short term, but when the urbanisation rate approaches 80%, CO2 emissions will reach a peak value and then decrease. Comparison of different urbanisation rates showed that production and living energy consumption exhibit different directions of change and rules in urban and rural areas. The effect of urbanisation on CO2 emissions and energy structure is not direct, and urbanisation can increase the differences in energy and CO2 emissions between urban and rural areas caused by the industrial structure, technical level and other factors.

AB This paper evaluates the current conditions of Ugandan low-income tropical housing with a focus on construction methods and materials in order to identify the key areas for improvement. Literature review, site visits and photographic surveys are carried out to collect relevant information on prevailing construction methods/materials and on their environmental impacts in rural areas. Low quality, high waste, and energy intensive production methods, as well as excessive soil extraction and deforestation, are identified as the main environmental damage of the current construction methods and materials. The embodied energy is highlighted as the key area which should be addressed to reduce the CO2 emissions of low-income tropical housing. The results indicate that the embodied energy of fired bricks in Uganda is up to 5.7 times more than general clay bricks. Concrete walling is identified as a much more environmentally friendly construction method compared to brick walling in East African countries. Improving fuel efficiency and moulding systems, increasing access to renewable energy sources, raising public awareness, educating local manufacturers and artisans, and gradual long-term introduction of innovative construction methods and materials which are adapted to local needs and conditions are some of the recommended actions to improve the current conditions.

AB The paper focuses on public perception of sustainable homes in a developing economy, namely Saudi Arabia, known for its high energy consumption and CO2 emission rates. The research explores (i) public perception and knowledge of sustainable and/or low energy homes, (ii) domestic stock typology (including architectural style), (iii) energy consumption patterns, (iv) levels of satisfaction with energy (i.e. HVAC) systems, (v) cultural barriers that prevent the delivery of low energy homes, and (vi) people's acceptance of energy retrofitting and/or sustainable homes. For this purpose, a comprehensive survey (n = 622) was conducted across the country. The findings reveal limited public awareness as well as important socio-cultural barriers to the delivery of sustainable homes, and large scale energy retrofitting of the existing domestic stock.

ID EMISSIONS
AB Building construction consumes large amount of energy and material. Despite that, not much effort has been directed to examine the environmental impact of the construction phase, and this is particularly relevant to Hong Kong where the demand for building construction is ever increasing. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) model namely the Environmental Model of Construction (EMoC) is developed to help decision-makers assess the environmental performance of building construction projects in Hong Kong from cradle to end of construction. The model provides comprehensive analyses of 18 environmental impact categories at the midpoint and endpoint levels. By inputting project specific data to EMoC, it can generate results of over two-hundred detailed processes. A public rental housing (PRH) project is fed into EMoC to examine the environmental performance of this type of projects. The results indicate that material is the major contributor to environmental impacts of the upstream stages of public housing construction. The carbon emissions of the studied project amount to 637 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per square meter of the gross floor area. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the environmental pollution can be significantly reduced by adopting a higher proportion of precast concrete components. The model should help support decision-makers identifying pragmatic solutions to reduce the environmental burden of a building project at the design, procurement and construction stages.

AB Turkey's diverse regions lead to complex issues in sustainability. We studied to cities in different areas of the country to examine the effects of local climate on energy use in energy-efficient buildings. Erzurum is the coldest city; Antalya lies in the Mediterranean region and has the highest solar global horizontal radiation in Turkey. We used Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) values for both cities to estimate the energy demand for heating and cooling the buildings. In Erzurum, CO2 emissions are high, because fuel consumption to heat the same building is more than 4 times of that of Antalya in winter. CO2 emission is significant as the key greenhouse gas. In Antalya, the electricity costs for cooling the same building are more than 42 times that of Erzurum; CO2 emissions are also higher during summer. A building certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) uses about 35% less energy for heating and cooling in both cities. The economic and environmental contributions of a LEED-certified building in Erzurum is higher during cold weather, while in Antalya, a LEED-certified building conserves comparatively more energy and retains more CO2 during hot weather. The results show that the LEED Certification System can be a more international system if geographical and climatic differences are also taken into consideration.

AB Household energy consumption has been increasing in the last decades; the residential sector is responsible for about 40% of the total final energy use in Europe. Energy efficiency measures can both reduce energy needs of buildings and energy-related CO2 emissions. For this reason, in recent years, the European Union has been making efforts to enhance energy saving in buildings by introducing various policies and strategies; in this context, a common methodology was developed to assess and to certify energy performance of buildings. The positive effects obtained by energy efficiency measures need to be verified, but measuring and monitoring building energy performance is time consuming and financially demanding. Alternatively, energy efficiency can also be evaluated by specific indicators based on energy consumption. In this work, a methodology to investigate the level of energy efficiency reached in the Umbria Region (Central Italy) is described, based on data collected by energy certificates. In fact, energy certificates, which are the outcomes of simulation models, represent a useful and available tool to collect data related to the energy use of dwellings. A database of building energy performance was developed, in which about 6500 energy certificates of residential buildings supplied by Umbria region were inserted. On the basis of this data collection, average energy and CO2 indicators related to the building heritage in Umbria were estimated and compared to national and international indicators derived from official sources. Results showed that the adopted methodology in this work can be an alternative method for the evaluation of energy indicators; in fact, the ones calculated considering simulation data were similar to the ones reported in national and international sources. This allowed to validate the adopted methodology and the efficiency of European policies.

TI A novel hybrid methodology to evaluate sustainable retrofitting in

ID EMBODIED ENERGY; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SYSTEMS
AB Energy and environmental issues are increasingly important in existing building service and energy systems around the world. Despite great efforts to implement retrofit techniques in Sweden, no stringent evaluation of the benefits of these techniques or their systematic design has been completed. Traditional evaluations have not taken into account the embodied energy and greenhouse gases emissions of different retrofit options. This omission leads to underestimation of the potential environmental benefits of modern retrofit techniques. In this study a novel hybrid modeling approach to quantify the sustainability of retrofit options is developed to fill these knowledge gaps. The compatibility of environmental and energy saving modeling of various energy-saving techniques for future transition of Swedish residential building stock is analyzed. Consolis Retro and the life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques are employed and further coupled to simulate retrofit options. The model integrates both energy demand (net operational energy), primary energy (operational energy from energy mix to buildings) into evaluation criteria. Embodied energy (energy required to produce materials of retrofitting options) and embodied greenhouse gas emissions (upstream CO2 equivalent) are introduced as new measures in the evaluation criteria. The results showed that low-temperature heating retrofitting was the most effective option from both a primary and embodied energy perspective in the studied building types. Combining circulation pump renovations could further contribute to the efficiency of low-temperature heating for energy-demand savings. High operational energy-saving measures may not always lead to larger reduction in both embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions, particularly for building envelope retrofitting. Neglecting the embodied energy of retrofit options will increase the risk of overrepresenting their energy-saving contributions. The sustainability improvements of retrofitting, particularly large-scale measures, should take into account the embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions from the material productions.

AB Different policies of the UK government have been initiated to reduce energy consumption in the housing sector. Various models have been developed to analyse the impact of these policies, which are classified as disciplinary or multidisciplinary models comprising variables related to technology, economic, sociology, occupants behaviour and climate. While being multidisciplinary, these models have limitations in simulating the complexity of household energy consumption. As a sociotechnical problem, this research aims to develop a system dynamics model to analyse profiles of household energy consumption considering the interrelationships among these influential variables. The model can assess the effect of different energy initiatives before/during their implementation. The proposed model has been used to test the effectiveness of the UK initiative Green Deal (GD) based on the most recent statistics released by the government. The model results indicate that carbon dioxide emissions savings of about 40% and 60% below the base year of 1990 are possible by 2020 and 2050, respectively. As a policy advice tool, this means that it is unlikely for this initiative by its own to meet the required legally binding reductions of 80% cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 unless the GD initiative is vigorously pursued with other energy initiatives.

AB Energy efficiency in the residential sector is one of the priorities of the European Union. It is estimated to achieve an energy saving of 27% in the group of buildings in the residential sector in the EU countries by 2020 through the directives issued by the European Commission. The housing stock of Spain are among the least energy efficient in Europe as a result, try to introduce governmental aid to encourage thermal refurbishment of residential buildings. Currently programs energy rating in Spain focus on the evaluation of annual CO2 emissions, however indicators annual primary energy consumption or investment cost improvement measures are not taken into account (Rua & Lopez-Mesa, 2012). The target is investigates the economic aspects of investment and savings in energy efficiency improvements to houses, making a comparison between alternatives and starting situations that may appear at the time to evaluate the response of a building with order to deepen another valid indicator for EE actions on existing buildings (Ahern, Griffiths & O'Flaherty, 2013).

AB This research is the first attempt of a carbon emission investigation of tourism-based farms. A total of 36 cases were investigated. The result reveals that each tourist returns an average revenue of 28.6 USD and generates an average 10.9 kg-CO(2)eq per visit of carbon emissions. The average carbon emission density for each land area is 8.2 t/hayear and is 245 kg/m(2)year for each floor area. It is estimated that the overall carbon emissions reach 321,751 tons annually. The tourism-based farms were clustered into five categories, based on their business characteristics. It was found that high-end vacation leisure farms produce 2.46 times the carbon emissions than natural eco-conservation farms. Carbon emissions were 42% higher than the annual average in July and August. A secondary high season is in February, but it is merely higher than the annual average by 8% because of the mild climate. Two significant models for predicting carbon emissions were constructed by stepwise regression. As agriculture administrative authorities in Taiwan gradually have begun admitting the cultivated lands for multi-purpose usage, tourism-based farms have been increasing drastically. This study provides references for both public authorities and farm managers in exploring the issues with regard to carbon emissions and farm sustainability.

AB The construction industry provides extensive impacts to the environment with population increases further driving these pressures. In an attempt to mitigate these impacts, the industry as a whole has promoted and developed numerous green building rating systems (GBRS). These GBRS assign scores to buildings based on a variety of assessment criteria to determine a structures environmental impact. Previous research has identified shortfalls in certain areas related to these GBRS. In order to gain further insight into these systems an industry survey was conducted to establish an alternate perspective. The outcomes of this survey were consistent with that of previous research, identifying the requirement for an increase in the Embodied Energy (EE) consideration of structures in GBRS. The average estimation of the contribution of EE to a structures life cycle consumption was 28.4%. The survey findings also identified a number of other key areas through which changes in the consideration of sustainable development could be improved. The use of these findings and their comparison to previous research outcomes would assist in the development of supplementary mechanisms to improve the assessment of the environmental performance of structures.

AB The paper investigates the introduction of a MCHP (Micro Combined Heat and Power) system in buildings with low energy demand with respect to the current building stock. A load sharing approach between a multifamily residential building and an office one is taken into account. Dynamic simulations are carried out in order to evaluate the thermo-economic performance of the analyzed system. Particular attention is given to the estimation of the electric load of the different users, as the economic profitability of a MCHP system is strongly influenced by the amount of self-consumed electricity. In order to analyze the influence of climatic conditions, two different geographical locations in Italy (Naples and Turin, having 1034 and 2617 heating degree days, respectively) are considered. The results of this study indicate that the installation of MCHP systems in buildings with low energy demand allows to increase the percentage of self-consumed electricity reducing the bidirectional electricity flow between the users and the external grid, as well as the impact on the grid itself due to the large diffusion of distributed generation systems. Moreover this study shows that the load sharing approach between users with different load profile leads to better energy, environmental and economic results with respect to a conventional system. The climatic conditions play an important role on the MCHP operational hours and hence on the thermo-economic performance of the system. The primary energy saving of the system located in Turin is equal to 8.8% with respect to 6.2% of the system located in Naples. Also the environmental performance, evaluated in terms of equivalent CO2 avoided emissions, are better in Turin (8.3%) than in Naples (6.7%). The economic analysis shows acceptable values of the pay-back period in presence of economic support mechanisms. The findings of this study show that the introduction of a MCHP system in load sharing approach leads to thermo-economics advantages even considering the lower heating needs of well-insulated buildings.

TI Emergy-based sustainability assessment of different energy options for

SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT

AB It is necessary to minimize the environmental impact and utilize natural resources in a sustainable and efficient manner in the early design stage of developing an environmentally-conscious design for a heating, ventilating and air-conditioning system. Energy supply options play a significant role in the total environmental load of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems. To assess the environmental impact of different energy options, a new method based on Emergy Analysis is proposed. Emergy Accounting, was first developed and widely used in the area of ecological engineering, but this is the first time it has been used in building service engineering. The environmental impacts due to the energy options are divided into four categories under the Emergy Framework: the depletion of natural resources, the greenhouse effect (carbon dioxide equivalents), the chemical rain effect (sulfur dioxide equivalents), and anthropogenic heat release. The depletion of non-renewable natural resources is indicated by the Environmental Load Ratio, and the environmental carrying capacity is developed to represent the environmental service to dilute the pollutants and anthropogenic heat released. This Emergy evaluation method provides a new way to integrate different environmental impacts under the same framework and thus facilitates better system choices. A case study of six different kinds of energy options consisting of renewable and non-renewable energy was performed by using Emergy Theory, and thus their relative environmental impacts were compared. The results show that the method of electricity generation in energy sources, especially for electricity-powered systems, is the most important factor to determine their overall environmental performance. The direct-fired lithium-bromide absorption type consumes more non-renewable energy, and contributes more to the urban heat island effect compared with other options having the same electricity supply. Using Emergy Analysis, designers and clients can make better-informed, environmentally-conscious selections of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI 120 Years of US Residential Housing Stock and Floor Space
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS; SECTOR; HOUSEHOLD
AB Residential buildings are a key driver of energy consumption and also impact transportation and land-use. Energy consumption in the residential sector accounts for one-fifth of total U.S. energy consumption and energy-related CO2 emissions, with floor space a major driver of building energy demands. In this work a consistent, vintage-disaggregated, annual long-term series of U.S. housing stock and residential floor space for 1891-2010 is presented. An attempt was made to minimize the effects of the incompleteness and inconsistencies present in the national housing survey data. Over the 1891-2010 period, floor space increased almost tenfold, from approximately 24,700 to 235,150 million square feet, corresponding to a doubling of floor space per capita from approximately 400 to 800 square feet. While population increased five times over the period, a 50% decrease in household size contributed towards a tenfold increase in the number of housing units and floor space, while average floor space per unit remains surprisingly constant, as a result of housing retirement dynamics. In the last 30 years, however, these trends appear to be changing, as household size shows signs of leveling off, or even increasing again, while average floor space per unit has been increasing. GDP and total floor space show a remarkably constant growth trend over the period and total residential sector primary energy consumption and floor space show a similar growth trend over the last 60 years, decoupling only within the last decade.

AB This paper provides an analysis of the socio-economic and dwelling factors contributing to high electrical energy demand in UK domestic buildings. The socio-economic, dwelling and electricity consumption data were collected during a large-scale, city-wide survey, carried out in Leicester, UK, in 2009-2010. Annual electrical energy demand was estimated for 315 dwellings and an odds ratio analysis used to identify the socio-economic and dwelling factors that led to high electricity consumption. The effects of a number of socio-economic and dwelling factors which have not previously been studied for the UK domestic sector are included. Thus, for the first time, presence of teenagers, having electric space heating as the primary form of heating, portable electric heating and electric water heating were identified as significant drivers of high electricity demand in UK homes. The employment status and education level of the Household Representative Person, the number of floors in a dwelling, presence of fixed electric heating, and the proportion of low-energy lighting were shown to have no effect on high electricity consumption in UK homes. Given the impetus to reduce electricity consumption and CO2 emissions from the domestic sector, these observations can help shape energy saving campaigns and future energy policy.

AB The Vaxja municipality sets specific energy related requirements beyond the Swedish building code (BBR) when selling land for the construction of new residential buildings. The requirement for Ostra Lugnet residential area was that all buildings must be connected to the local district heating network and installation of heat pumps was prohibited in developer-built group/row houses. This paper (a) analyzed if the energy use of the buildings fulfilled the requirements of the BBR and that of Vaxjb municipality, and (b) compared the primary energy use and CO2 emission from operation of the district heated buildings with hypothetical scenarios where only air-source or bedrock heat pumps were installed. Results showed that a significant proportion of the group/row houses did not fulfil the specific energy use requirements of the BBR and that of Vaxio municipality. There were large variations between predicted and actual energy use. Using a marginal accounting approach, houses with district heating were found to have the lowest carbon emission. From this perspective it seems appropriate for Vaxjb municipality to set the requirement that new residential buildings in Ostra Lugnet be connected to the local district heating network.

AB Avoiding urban sprawl and increasing density are often considered as effective means to mitigate climate change through urban planning. However, there have been rapid technological changes in the fields of housing energy and private driving, and the development is continuing. In this study, we analyze the carbon footprints of the residents living in new housing in different urban forms in Finland. We compare the new housing to existing housing stock. In all areas, the emissions from housing energy were significantly lower in new buildings. However, in the inner urban areas the high level of consumption, mostly due to higher affluence, reverse the gains of energy efficient new housing. The smallest carbon footprints were found in newly built outer and pen-urban areas, also when income level differences were taken into account. Rather than strengthening the juxtaposition of urban and suburban areas, we suggest that it would be smarter to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of both modes of living and develop a more systemic strategy that would result in greater sustainability in both areas. Since such strategy does not exist yet, it should be researched and practically developed. It would be beneficial to focus on area specific mitigation measures.

AB A methodology for selecting the best cooling system for small scale residential building was introduced. A benchmark building was assumed to be cooled by various cooling alternatives. The proposed systems were analyzed based on 3E (energy, economic, and environmental) as well as thermal comfort analyses. Finally, based on fuzzy-AHP method, the best cooling alternative in each climatic condition was selected. It was suggested to implement direct evaporative cooling (DEC) in all dry areas. In wet and hot areas, the best option was the vapor compression system; however, in temperate and humid, very hot and semi-humid, and temperate and wet cities, desiccant-enhanced evaporative cooling (DEVap) was the best alternative. It reduced the annual primary energy consumption (PEC) and carbon dioxide emission (CDE) up to 13970 kWh and 3.3 tons of CO2, respectively. Implementing DEC reduced PEC, CDE, and cooling cost of dry area up to 4875 kWh, 5.6 tons of CO2, and 168 $, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

AB The European policy framework is focused on reducing energy consumption in the building sector. The recast of Energy Performance of Buildings (EPBD) Directive establishes that minimum energy performance requirements have to be set to achieve cost-optimal levels.
   A methodology is developed to assess energy and cost effectiveness in new buildings located in the Mediterranean area. Several energy efficiency technical variants are applied to a multi residential reference building selected as a representative model of the national building stock. Primary energy consumption and global costs are evaluated in a number of configurations to derive the cost-optimal solution.
   The paper shows how economical high efficient buildings can be obtained at a design stage for a warm climate. The selected configuration decreases primary energy consumption by 90% and CO2 emissions by 88% with respect to the baseline building.
   Results appear useful for comparison with other climates and building types. The paper also points out that the methodology is suitable to guide and support the choice of cost effective energy efficiency measures in compliance with EU requirements. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The changes in Spanish legislation on energy efficiency seek to set the basis for achieving European energy and climate goals, especially insofar as decreasing primary energy consumption and reducing CO2 emissions. This has led to positive changes in energy in the building sector from traditional construction methods which did not consider energy efficiency (e.g., did not include envelope insulation). This study analyzed 342 residential buildings built from 1981 to 2015 and characterized their parameters (areas, orientation, number of stories, etc.), envelopes, domestic hot water, and heating and air-conditioning systems. Based on this characterization, a model single-family dwelling and another model multifamily dwelling were designed to evaluate their energy efficiency as a function of changes in construction and their cost in southeast Spain. The main results were that recently built buildings (built after 2006) have included domestic hot water from solar sources, insulating materials in their envelopes and have considerably improved construction systems, due to the requirements of current legislation. Fruit of these improvements is a drop in CO2 emissions of up to 82%, according to calculations done with official programmes. From an economic perspective, these changes have raised construction costs by 11% in multifamily dwellings and 17% in single-family dwellings. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a method of integrating decentralized energy systems at neighbourhood scale. The method is based on the energy hub concept, which describes and manages the relation between input and output energy flows and thus can be used to optimise energy consumption. The original energy hub concept is further developed to include decentralized and local energy technologies such as photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power, together with district heating systems, building and district conversion and storage technologies at neighbourhood level. Additionally, input from a building simulation tool for evaluating time-dependent buildings energy demand is included in the method. The proposed approach can be used to evaluate and size urban energy systems according to their energy-autonomy, economic and ecological performance. The advantage is that the energy supply systems and local energy storage systems can be evaluated in a combined way at district scale. The suggested method allows to lower peaks in energy demands of neighbourhoods on the electrical grid and to reduce the overall consumption. The developed method is finally applied on a case study for which future energy scenarios of different implementation scale are suggested. The area is located in a village in the mountains and contains 29 buildings. Suggested scenarios include decentralized and local renewable energy sources and district and small heating networks. Results show a variation of 52-98 tons of CO2 emissions, and an energy autonomy between 64% and 92%. In case of CO2 emissions, the best solution is given for a combination of multiple supply technologies and small networks which shows 46% lower emissions than for a scenario with only PV and biomass based systems.

AB Given the background of global warming, carbon emission reduction has become a topic of global importance. Land use change not only influences carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems directly, but it also indirectly affects anthropogenic carbon emissions, which occur more frequently in coastal regions. Based on data of energy consumption, industrial products, waste, soil organic carbon, and vegetation, together with land use images of five typical years, this paper calculated the total carbon emissions in coastal Jiangsu, China, assigned the detailed carbon emission items to different land use types, and optimized land use structure to low carbon emissions using the Linear Programming Model. It was found that carbon emission intensity in coastal Jiangsu was much higher than the average for China as a whole, and that energy consumption contributed most to local carbon emissions with the contribution from animals second. Urban land accounted for the most concentrated and highest intensity of carbon emissions. Between 1985 and 2010, the transfer of cropland to built-up land accounted for the largest percentage of the total transferred area and contributed most to the increase of carbon emissions. In particular, the limitation of urban land will play a key role in carbon emission reduction. Our optimized land use structure can control and decrease carbon emissions effectively and thus, it is an important tool worth the consideration of land managers and policy makers.

AB The embodied and operating energy consumption of the civil building sector accounts for more than 30% of the national consumption. It is of great significance to probe the energy saving potential of the building sector and to explore the critical factors responsible for its energy saving practice, which may greatly benefit carbon emission reduction in the process of urbanization. In this paper, we develop a series of formulations to calculate both embodied and operating energy based on hybrid energy input-output model. Taking 2011-2050 as the study period, we combined the embodied and operating energy and designed six scenarios to comprehensively quantify the impacts of three factors: new building floor areas, energy efficiency standards and its implementation rate on the energy saving potential. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was conducted to dissect the influence of the corresponding factors. The results show that improved standards and less new building floor areas will be the most effective ways to reduce energy consumption and that the best energy saving practice can save up to 20 billion tons of coal equivalent (tce) during the study period. The focus of policy reforms may be varied according to the times and regions. Energy saving technology development and more emphasis on key areas will reduce building energy consumption significantly in the short term, while household lifestyle changes, as well as improved building energy efficiency, should be given a higher priority in the long run.

AB In order to achieve meaningful climate protection targets at the global scale, each country is called to set national energy policies aimed at reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. By calculating the monthly heating energy demand of dwellings in the Netherlands, our case study country, we contrast the results with the corresponding aspired national targets. Considering different future population scenarios, renovation measures and temperature variations, we show that a near zero energy demand in 2050 could only be reached with very ambitious renovation measures. While the goal of reducing the energy demand of the building sector by 50% until 2030 compared to 1990 seems feasible for most provinces and months in the minimum scenario, it is impossible in our scenario with more pessimistic yet still realistic assumptions regarding future developments. Compared to the current value, the annual renovation rate per province would need to be at least doubled in order to reach the 2030 target independent of reasonable climatic and population changes in the future. Our findings also underline the importance of policy measures as the annual renovation rate is a key influencing factor regarding the reduction of the heating energy demand in dwellings.

AB According to a press release, the building sector accounts for about 40% of the global primary energy consumption. Energy savings can be achieved in the building sector by improving the building's dynamic energy performance in terms of sustainable construction management in the urban-based built environments (referred to as an "Urban Organism"). This study implements the concept of "dynamic approach" to reflect the unexpected changes in the climate and energy environments as well as in the energy policies and technologies. Research in this area is very significant for the future of the building, energy, and environmental industries around the world. However, there is a lack of studies from the perspective of the dynamic approach and the system integration, and thus, this study is designed to fill the research gap. This study highlights the state-of-the-art in the major phases for a building's dynamic energy performance (i.e., monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting phases), focusing on the operation and maintenance phase. This study covers a wide range of research works and provides various illustrative examples of the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance. Finally, this study proposes the specific future developments and challenges by phase and suggests the future direction of system integration for the development of a carbon-integrated management system as a large complex system. It is expected that researchers and practitioners can understand and adopt the holistic approach in the monitoring, diagnosing, and retrofitting of a building's dynamic energy performance under the new paradigm of an "Urban Organism".

AB This paper provides an assessment of the potential of CO2 mitigation in buildings by conducting an empirical research on the determinants of building energy-related CO2 emissions. The building sector accounts for 30%-50% of CO2 emissions and thus has significant impacts on global warming. This paper fills the research gap by investigating the economic factors that determine energy-related CO2 emissions in China's commercial and residential buildings. Based on provincial data, a three-dimensional LMDI decomposition of building energy-related CO2 emissions into four components is proposed, and includes scale, income, intensity and structure effects. The results suggest that (i) China's building energy-related CO2 emissions are increasing rapidly; (ii) The improvement in living standards is the leading driving force of the increases in emissions, but its importance diminishes due to energy efficiency improvement and transformation to low-carbon energy structure; (iii) The evolution of China's commercial building energy-related CO2 emissions shows the features of the environmental Kuznets curve; (iv) CO2 emissions would further increase in the developed eastern regions due to large-scale migration from rural to urban areas.

TI Assessing uncertainty in housing stock infiltration rates and associated
   heat loss: English and UK case studies

AB Strategies to reduce domestic heating loads by minimizing the infiltration of cold air through adventitious openings located in the thermal envelopes of houses are highlighted by the building codes of many countries. Consequent reductions of energy demand and CO(2)e emission are often unquantified by empirical evidence. Instead, a mean heating season infiltration rate is commonly inferred from an air leakage rate using a simple ratio scaled to account for the physical and environmental properties of a dwelling. The scaling does not take account of the permeability of party walls in conjoined dwellings and so cannot differentiate between the infiltration of unconditioned ambient air that requires heating, and conditioned air from adjacent dwellings that does not.
   A stochastic method is presented that applies a theoretical model of adventitious infiltration to predict distributions of mean infiltration rates and the associated total heat loss in any stock of dwellings during heating hours. The method is applied to the English and UK housing stocks and provides probability distribution functions of stock infiltration rates and total heat loss during the heating season for two extremes of party wall permeability. The distributions predict that up to 79% of the current English stock could require additional purpose-provided ventilation to limit negative health consequences. National models predict that fewer dwellings are under-ventilated. The distributions are also used to predict that infiltration is responsible for 3-5% of total UK energy demand, 11-15% of UK housing stock energy demand, and 10-14% of UK housing stock carbon emissions.

AB Wood pellet storage safety is an important aspect for implementing woody biomass as a renewable energy source. When wood pellets are stored indoors in large quantities (tons) in poorly ventilated spaces in buildings, such as in basements, off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can significantly affect indoor air quality. To determine the emission rates and potential impact of VOC emissions, a series of laboratory and field measurements were conducted using softwood, hardwood, and blended wood pellets manufactured in New York. Evacuated canisters were used to collect air samples from the headspace of drums containing pellets and then in basements and pellet storage areas of homes and small businesses. Multiple peaks were identified during GC/MS and GC/FID analysis, and four primary VOCs were characterized and quantified: methanol, pentane, pentanal, and hexanal. Laboratory results show that total VOCs (TVOCs) concentrations for softwood (SW) were statistically (p < 0.02) higher than blended or hardwood (HW) (SW: 412 +/- 25; blended: 203 +/- 4; HW: 99 +/- 8, ppb). The emission rate from HW was the fastest, followed by blended and SW, respectively. Emissions rates were found to range from 10(-1) to 10(-5) units, depending upon environmental factors. Field measurements resulted in airborne concentrations ranging from 67 +/- 8 to 5000 +/- 3000 ppb of TVOCs and 12 to 1500 ppb of aldehydes, with higher concentrations found in a basement with a large fabric bag storage unit after fresh pellet delivery and lower concentrations for aged pellets. These results suggest that large fabric bag storage units resulted in a substantial release of VOCs into the building air. Occupants of the buildings tested discussed concerns about odor and sensory irritation when new pellets were delivered. The sensory response was likely due to the aldehydes.

AB There has been a growing public concern on global warming and associated implications, which is arguably due to greenhouse gas emissions (carbon emission). Building stock is one of biggest emitters. As a result, a number of studies have been undertaken to investigate the effective ways of carbon emission reduction in buildings. However, there is lack of a systematic investigation of the interactive relationship between various factors related to low carbon building. Vast majority of existing studies place focus on one aspect of low carbon building, e.g. policy, technology, awareness, etc. An integrated Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) and Matrice d'Impacts croises-multipication applique a classment (MICMAC) approach is adopted in this study to explore the interactions amongst various factors related to low carbon buildings. Outcome of the integrated ISM and MICMAC modeling exercise provides a visualized tool for facilitating the low carbon building developments. This study not only identified the critical success factors for the implementation of low carbon buildings, but also explored how they interacted. Results showed that higher priority should be assigned to international cooperation, macro-level management, the development of low-carbon theories and technologies due to their strong driving power to low carbon buildings. As a result, other factors such as low-carbon facilities, the structure of building energy consumption, and low carbon building project practice will be developed rapidly because of their strong dependent power. This in turn helps to promote the low carbon building developments. Therefore, these factors need to be taken into consideration during policy making process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an analysis of the spatial-temporal evolution of and regional differences in CO2 emissions from transportation in China during the period of 2000-2012 based on a transportation carbon-emission model. A two-way fixed effect model was constructed to examine socio-economic impacts and impacts of urban form and transportation development on CO2 emissions from transportation in China. The results indicated that the total and per capita CO2 emissions from transportation were growing at an annual rate of 9.29% and 8.69%, respectively, and that regional differences were inconsistent during this period. Most socio-economic, urban form and transportation development factors had a significant positive effect on per capita CO2 emissions from transportation. Socio-economic development and increased income were the primary driving factors for the growth of per capita CO2 emissions from transportation. Urban population density, the size of built-up areas and urban road density should be controlled by planning to eliminate increased per capita CO2 emissions from transportation. Urban public transportation had a significant negative effect on per capita CO2 emissions from transportation, while the effect of car ownership was not significant, which indicated that providing well-developed urban public transportation and advocating behavior changes regarding travel were important ways to reduce per capita CO2 emissions from transportation. The findings of this study have important implications for reducing the growth of CO2 emissions from transportation in China and constructing low-carbon and sustainable city space environments.

AB A methodology for optimal sizing of the CCHP systems driven by Stirling prime movers for a residential application was presented. In this regard, a benchmark residential building with 1100 m(2) residential area was assumed in four cities to be delivered heat and power by a Stirling-CCHP system. The proposed Stirling-CCHP system was analyzed using 3E (energy, environment, and economic) analysis and three objective functions including primary energy saving, carbon dioxide emission reduction, and annual total cost saving were obtained. In energy analysis, the Stirling engine was analyzed using the CAFS method. The optimal size of the prime mover was obtained in four optimization scenarios, including three single-objective optimizations along with a multi-objective optimization scenario. In single-objective optimization, three objective functions were optimized separately while in a multi-objective scenario all objective were optimized simultaneously. The best option among four optimized Stirling-CCHP system was selected in each city using the fuzzy-AHP decision making method. It was found that in extremely hot and humid weather, Stirling-CCHP system is not recommended in all scenarios. In other weather conditions, the best configuration of the CCHP system with an acceptable payback period of investment was achieved in the cost optimization scenario. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Heat pumps are widely recognized as a key technology to reduce CO2 emissions in the residential building sector, especially when the electricity-generation system is to decarbonize by means of large-scale introduction of renewable electric power generation sources. If heat pumps would be installed in large numbers in the future, the question arises whether all building types show equal benefits and thus should be given the same priority for deployment. This paper aims at answering this question by determining the CO2-abatement cost of installing a heat pump instead of a condensing gas boiler for residential space heating and domestic hot-water production. The electricity system, as well as the building types, are based on a possible future Belgian setting in 2030 with high RES penetration at the electricity-generation side. The added value of this work compared to the current scientific literature lies in the integrated approach, taking both the electricity-generation system and a bottom up building stock model into account. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the possible benefits of active demand response in this framework. The results show that the main drivers for determining the CO2-abatement cost are the renovation level of the building and the type of heat pump installed. For thoroughly insulated buildings, an air-coupled heat pump combined with floor heating is the most economic heating system in terms of CO2-abatement cost. Finally, performing active demand response shows clear benefits in reducing costs. Substantial peak shaving can be achieved, making peak capacity at the electricity generation side superfluous, hence lowering the overall CO2-abatement cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A systematic analysis of green-house gases emission (carbon footprint) and primary energy consumption (energy footprint) of prefabricated industrial buildings during their entire life cycle is presented. The life cycle assessment (LCA) study was performed in a cradle-to grave approach: site-specific data from an Italian company, directly involved in all the phases from raw material manufacturing to in-situ assembly, were used to analyze the impacts as a function of different design choices. Four buildings were analyzed and results were used to setup a parameterized model that was used to study the impacts of industrial prefabricated buildings over the input parameter space. The model vs. data agreement is within 4% for both carbon and energy footprint. The functional unit is 1 m(3) of prefabricated building, considering a 50-year lifetime. The results of the four buildings decrease from 144.6 kgCO(2eq)/m(3) and 649.5 kWh/m(3) down to 123.5 kgCO(2eq)/m(3) and 556.8 kWh/m(3) as the building floor area increases from 1048 m(2) to 21,910 m(2). The use phase accounts for the major impact (approximate 76%). It is found that the carbon footprint is proportional to the energy footprint, the proportional factor being 0.222 kgCO(2eq)/kWh within 0.5% accuracy. Finally, a systematic study of the sensitivity of input parameters (insulation, lifetime, foundation type) is presented.

AB To meet increasingly stringent emission legislation, electric vehicles are expected to offer promising sustainable mobility in the future. However, the driving range of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is limited as compared with hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Additionally, the grid power supply in China is highly dependent on coal-based thermal power generation, which leads to high grid-carbon intensity and increased well-to-tank (WTT) emission for BEVs. Therefore, the tradeoff between electric vehicle driving range and environmental impact has become a critical problem in BEV development in China.
   In this study, a BEV model is built and validated. The energy consumption and well-to-wheel (WTW) CO2 emission rates of different driving ranges and test cycles are simulated. To determine the impact of driving patterns on BEV energy consumption, the distribution of vehicle energy consumption is analyzed and an analytical model is proposed to generalize the energy consumption of BEVs in standardized driving cycles to real-world driving with only two statistical characteristics: the average and the variance of the speeds. It is found that BEVs have a great advantage in terms of energy saving only at driving cycles with low average speeds and frequent stops. While driving at highway speeds, the energy consumption of BEVs can be very high. With an understanding of driving pattern impact, parameter variation analysis of the BEV WTW CO2 emission rates for different driving ranges is simulated. Simulation results show that the rolling coefficient and battery energy density have a significant impact on driving range, followed by the drag area. However, grid-carbon intensity is more efficient for reducing WTW CO2 emissions. Currently, optimization of the rolling coefficient and drag area is the most viable option for increasing the battery range and decreasing the WTW CO2 emission rate.
   Finally, to reduce the energy and environmental impact of BEVs in China, short driving ranges (<250 km) and low driving speeds (<80 km/h) are suggested for current BEVs, and optimization of the vehicle design and reduction of grid-carbon intensity are considered to be the most critical issues for the future application of BEVs.

AB Nowadays the increasing demand for sustainable mobility has fostered the introduction of innovative propulsion systems also in the public transport sector in order to achieve a significant reduction of pollutant emissions in highly congested urban areas. This paper describes both the design and the optimization of an environmentally friendly hybrid bus (hereafter referred to as "HYBUS") for urban public transportation.
   After a preliminary description of the main features of the hybrid architecture, this paper assessed, through numerical simulations, the fuel economy potential of the hybridization in real world driving conditions. The promising results of this first part of the study led to the development of a first prototype. The first prototype of the bus was built by integrating an innovative hybrid propulsion system featuring a plug-in series architecture into the chassis of an old IVECO 490 TURBOCITY. The bus is 12 m long and capable to host up to 116 passengers in the original layout. The project relied on a modular approach where the powertrain could be easily customized for size and power, depending on the specific application.
   The prototype was then extensively tested in the city of Genoa, Italy, an urban context extremely challenging for a hybrid powertrain due to its frequent uphill routes and significant road grades. The outcomes of the test campaign confirmed the simulations forecasts, and fostered additional analysis aimed to optimize the energy management strategy of the hybrid powertrain.
   Numerical simulations were then used in order to identify more refined energy management strategies capable of further enhancing the fuel economy potential of the hybrid architecture. Consequently, a novel energy management was developed, and virtually tested, to manage the HYBUS in a more effective way. The results demonstrated the interesting potential of such hybrid architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dwellings are a substantial source of global CO2 emissions. The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have-on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010-2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB IFORE (Innovation for Renewal) is an EU Interreg funded partnership including two large housing associations, one in England, one in France, and a university from each country. The project is an exemplar large-scale retrofit, 100 houses have been retrofitted at Rushenden, on the Isle of Sheppey (Kent, England), and a similar number at Outreau, a suburb of Boulogne (Pas-de-Calais, France). This paper offers an overview of the methods used by the project team to find common solutions and to identify similarities between retrofit measures and occupant's behaviour in both countries. The cross-border nature of IFORE makes the project also original in relation to other similar national retrofit projects that have been developed prior to it. Dynamic thermal simulation was used to evaluate the thermal behaviour of the buildings refurbished. It is a valuable decision-making tool when assessing alternative retrofit measures. Initial surveys were carried out to make a classification of the housing stock which formed the context for the computer simulations. Some results from the simulations, carried out with ESP-r in England and Pleiade + Comfie in France, are presented in this paper. The comparison of the results from the two simulation tools shows great similarity between the two methods, which gave confidence for their use in evaluating alternative specifications for the works that have now been adopted for retrofit. At the same time sociological studies have characterised the populations in order to bring the most advantageous results from the retrofit works in reducing carbon emissions but also reducing fuel poverty whilst improving comfort standards.

AB The growing concerns of climate change require implementing measures to quantify, to monitor and to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nonetheless, most of the measures available are not easy to define or execute because they rely on current emissions and have a corrective character. To address this issue, a methodology to characterize GHG emissions that allows implementing preventive measures is proposed in this paper. The methodology is related to household urban planning procedures and considers urban infrastructures to characterize GHG emissions and to execute preventive measures based on sustainability design criteria. The methodology has been tested by applying it to a set of medium-sized municipalities with average GHG emissions from 6,822.32 kgCO(2eq)/year to 5,913.79 kgCO(2eq)/year for every residential unit. The results indicate that the greatest pollutant source is transport, especially in the issuance of street network design, followed by gas and electricity consumption. The average undevelopable land area required for the complete GHG emissions capture amounts to 3.42 m(2) of undevelopable land for every m(2) of urbanizable land and 9.02 m(2) of undevelopable land for every m(2) of built land.

AB Data centres consume high levels of energy to power the IT equipment contained within them, and extract the heat they produce. Because of the industry's heavy reliance on power, data centre metrics have historically used operational efficiency as a proxy for sustainability. More recently the industry has begun to recognise that its focus needs to go beyond energy consumption, with the creation of metrics for issues such as carbon, water and compute efficiency. However, single-issue metrics often consider only the operational phase, omitting impacts from other issues, during other stages in a facility's lifetime. Further approaches exist to assess more holistically the impact of data centres, such as building environmental assessment methods, but none have the capacity to capture fully the interlinked nature of a system, where improvements in one area and to one impact, can adversely affect a totally different area and totally different impacts.
   The following review of literature summarises the approach of the data centre industry to environmental impact, and provides direction for future research. Part 2 describes the use of building environmental assessment methods and tools; and concludes the need to apply life cycle thinking to more holistically assess the environmental impact of data centres.

   energy consumption
SO BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION

   energy use; non-domestic stock; offices
AB The influence of internal and external characteristics on energy use in the public sector office stock in England and Wales is explored using a database of 2600 Display Energy Certificates (DECs) combined with other sources of disaggregated office information. The DEC office benchmarks are shown to match the median fossil thermal and electrical consumptions well. Analyses of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), size, occupancy density, building age, location and rateable value are considered. While newer offices are shown to have lower typical fossil-thermal consumption than older offices, this is counterbalanced by higher electrical consumption, resulting in higher typical CO2 emissions. This has implications for the UK's emissions reduction targets for 2050, indicating that while building regulations that focus on thermal performance have been successful, a focus on electrical consumption (both regulated and unregulated) is key. The results are also compared with existing benchmarks for all UK offices, splitting the sample into four generic types, and compared with a similar smaller study of private offices. This indicates that public offices typically used less energy than the general benchmarks had previously predicted, particularly for prestige offices.

AB Carbon emissions calculation at the sub-provincial level has issues in limited data and non-unified measurements. This paper calculated the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions of the building industry in Wuhan, China. The findings showed that the proportion of carbon emissions in the construction operation phase was the largest, followed by the carbon emissions of the indirect energy consumption and the construction material preparation phase. With the purpose of analyzing the contributors of the construction carbon emissions, this paper conducted decomposition analysis using Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI). The results indicated that the increasing buidling area was the major driver of energy consumption and carbon emissions increase, followed by the behavior factor. Population growth and urbanization, to some extent, increased the carbon emissions as well. On the contrary, energy efficiency was the main inhibitory factor for reducing the carbon emissions. Policy implications in terms of low-carbon construction development were highlighted.

AB Brazil plans to meet the majority of its growing electricity demand with new hydropower plants located in the Amazon basin. However, large hydropower plants located in tropical forested regions may lead to significant carbon dioxide and methane emission. Currently, no predictive models exist to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions before the reservoir is built. This paper presents two different approaches to investigate the future carbon balance of eighteen new reservoirs in the Amazon. The first approach is based on a degradation model of flooded carbon stock, while the second approach is based on flux data measured in Amazonian rivers and reservoirs. The models rely on a Monte Carlo simulation framework to represent the balance of the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that results when land and river are converted into a reservoir. Further, we investigate the role of the residence time/stratification in the carbon emissions estimate. Our results imply that two factors contribute to reducing overall emissions from these reservoirs: high energy densities reservoirs, i.e., the ratio between the installed capacity and flooded area, and vegetation clearing. While the models' uncertainties are high, we show that a robust treatment of uncertainty can effectively indicate whether a reservoir in the Amazon will result in larger greenhouse gas emissions when compared to other electricity sources.

AB Background: Reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions in order to address climate change requires behavioral changes by the citizens, who will have to adopt more environmentally friendly and energy-saving practices.
   Methods: We present a system and corresponding practices for gathering energy consumption data from public school buildings over the Internet, processing them to identify hidden correlations and produce actionable advice and presenting the results in real-time to its occupants over the Web. We describe the metering infrastructure installed at schools for energy consumption monitoring and the related actions carried out in order to motivate local school communities towards an environmentally friendly behavior. The introduction of IPv6 was found to be a key enabling technology for setting up such a system in a simple, secure, and efficient way.
   Results: The proposed system and processes are put under test in a pilot installation composed of about 50 IPv6-enabled schools of the Greek School Network (GSN). These are also combined with appropriate educational and social engagement tools. In this way, energy consumption, operating costs, and greenhouse effects can be reduced in the area of educational and public administration buildings in general. Thus, people become almost instantly aware of the energy and environmental implications of their actions, which motivates them towards behavioral changes and the adoption of environmentally friendly practices.
   Conclusions: The pilot provides a good example of collaboration between the ICT sector, the smart building and automation vendors, and the public authorities.

AB Civil buildings in urban areas are one of the main sources of CO2 emissions. Many factors in civil buildings cause CO2 emissions to increase in China's urban areas. Factors that have influenced CO2 emissions from civil buildings in Chinese cities between 1997 and 2007 are studied using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. The following factors influence the increase of CO2 emissions: urban population, per capita floor space, building structure, building energy intensity and carbon emission coefficients. The results show that, between 1997 and 2007, increase in CO2 emissions by civil buildings in China's urban areas was largely driven by the increasing urban population and per capita floor space, which have contributed 56 and 87%, respectively, and present a trend of significant increase. The structural proportion change of areas of residential buildings and public buildings caused less of an impact of CO2 emissions. The reduction in the intensity of energy consumption of buildings is the major factor that could deter the increase in the rate of CO2 emissions, contributing 245%. However, this deterrence is slowing down. While maintaining the speed of urbanization of China, the key measures to suppress the increase in civil building CO2 emissions in urban areas are to reduce the intensity of building energy consumption and to control the per capita floor space.

AB Reducing the energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions of urban areas is paramount in research and practice, encompassing strategies to both reduce energy consumption and carbon intensity in both energy supply and demand. Most methods focus on one of these two approaches but few integrate decisions for supply and demand simultaneously. This paper presents a novel model that endogenously simulates energy supply and demand at a district scale on an hourly time scale. Demand is specified for a variety of building uses, and losses and municipal loads are calculated from the number of buildings in the district. Energy supply is modeled using technology-specific classes, allowing easy addition of specific equipment or types of energy generation. Standard interfaces allow expansion of the model to include new types of energy supply and demand. The model can be used for analysis of a single design alternative or optimization over a large design space, allowing exploration of various densities, mixes of uses, and energy supply technologies. An example optimization is provided for a community near San Francisco, California. This example uses 21 building types, 32 combined heat and power engines, and 16 chillers. The results demonstrate the ability to compare performance trade-offs and optimize for three objectives: life cycle cost, annual carbon dioxide emissions, and overall system efficiency.

AB Benchmarking the performance of local energy systems requires an integrated approach. This paper develops a composite index that consists of a unique set of 7 dimensions and 35 main indicators. The SDEWES (Sustainable Development of Energy, Water, and Environment Systems) Index is applied to a sample of 22 Mediterranean port cities. The index integrates energy and CO2 emissions data from SEAP (Sustainable Energy Action Plans). The values of the indicators are aggregated based on the Min-Max method for a final ranking. Nice, Venice, and Dubrovnik are the top three cities. An average city in the sample receives a composite score of 2.71. The results are subjugated to comparison based on three energy scenarios. The scenarios take into account reductions in final energy consumption per capita for a given area of the city based on smart energy measures. The scenarios represent improvements in the energy system that may include combined heat and power based district heating networks. A SDEWES Index Tool is developed to further allow cities to plan for potential changes in the final ranking based on energy scenarios. The SDEWES Index is useful to trigger learning, action, and collaboration among Mediterranean port cities to increase future performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently the construction sector faces tremendous challenges due to the distressing levels of buildings energy consumption. One stimulating approach is the incorporation of phase change materials (PCMs), which have the ability to store and release energy. This innovative work reports the direct incorporation of PCM into lightweight ceramic tiles. Lightweight bi-layered tiles, produced using wood wastes as pore forming agent, were impregnated with PCM under vacuum. The influence of PCM content on the materials thermal performance was determined. Results show that these PCM-containing ceramic tiles reduce indoor space temperature variation (up to 22%) enhancing the thermal comfort inside buildings. The indoor temperature can be directly controlled by the PCM content, with higher content inducing lower temperature variations. Nevertheless, it was found that the PCM load affects the tiles' thermal conductivity (percolation occurring between 2.5 and 3.9 wt%), while its physical state induces only minor changes. The incorporation of 5.4 wt% PCM was found to be the optimal content, which is a rather small amount in comparison with alternative PCM-containing building solutions.
   The novel PCM-ceramic tiles show improved thermal performance, in comparison with conventional ceramic tiles, mitigating the energy consumption inside buildings by decreasing the operation time of cooling/heating devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to an increased awareness of sustainable development and constructability, the construction industry is now facing challenges to reduce energy consumption, carbon emissions and other negative environmental impacts while maintaining high economic sustainability and constructability performance. This study investigates the performance of reinforced concrete framed (RC-framed) and structural steel framed (SS-framed) buildings on economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and constructability performance indicators in Singapore. The results suggest that economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and constructability performance are important in the decision making process for the selection of structural materials. While RC-framed buildings outperform SS-framed buildings in structural costs, maintenance costs and financial costs, SS-framed buildings outperform RC-framed buildings in increased area, flexibility of internal space, recycling rate, recyclability, waste rate, water consumption, labour saving, construction duration and construction quality. Both RC-framed buildings and SS-framed buildings performed on the same level in noise pollution and construction safety. The present study also provides a good guidance of selecting structural materials based on economic, environmental and constructable considerations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the paper is to provide the review towards the solar water heating system with phase change material. Research questions relating to the solar water heating system using phase change material were analyzed in two sides, i.e., structural characterization and research methodology, followed with the brief introduction of phase change material. The opportunities for further works were identified in technical and economical aspects. The technical opportunities involved in improving characteristics of phase change material for application in solar water heating system, developing novel solar water heating system for integration of system components with phase change material, performing long-term, real-weather and in-situ testing for optimizing operational and structural parameters of novel system, and proposing standardization of novel system for design, manufacture, utilization and marketing. The economical opportunities were presented as in conducting economical analysis to propose cost-effective system and evaluate the feasibility in different locations of the world, and providing subsidies to promote cost-effective system. This study will help identify the potential research gaps for the improvement of the energy efficiency of the solar water heating system and reduce the conventional fossil fuel consumption and carbon emission in the world. This research will also provide the guidance for the domestic and global researchers and engineers working on this area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In countries like the UK, the upkeep of existing buildings is where the greatest opportunities for achieving carbon reduction targets lie. Facades are the physical barriers between outdoors and indoors, and their upgrade can arguably be amongst the most effective interventions to improve the existing stock. Double Skin Facades (DSFs) represent a possible solution for low-carbon refurbishment due to their capability to reduce energy consumption, and the related carbon emissions, of the building they are applied to. Although much research exists on maximising the operational energy savings of DSFs, little is known about their life cycle performance. This article addresses such a knowledge gap through a comparative life cycle assessment between DSF refurbishments and an up-to-standard, single-skin alternative. This study adopts a parametric approach where 128 DSF configurations have been analysed through primary data. Energy and carbon (both operational and embodied) are the units assessed in this research. Results show that DSFs are more energy-efficient than single-skin in 98% of the cases, and more carbon-efficient in 85% of the cases. Not only does this study represent the first broad parametric approach to evaluating life cycle energy and carbon of DSFs within its given context, but it also informs environmentally-aware design and application of DSFs.

AB By 2020, different European Directives on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD) aim to reduce energy consumption by 20%, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and endorse a target of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources. These Directives have led EU Member States to develop systems, following their corresponding transposition into national law, to evaluate the energy efficiency of buildings, and create different Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). This has led to different energy efficiency measurement systems in the EU and a CO2 emissions scale has not been included by some Member States. Just as EPC is aimed at influencing the demand for energy-efficient buildings, this study is aimed at developing a straightforward procedure to obtain the environmental impact in the use phase of a building in kgCO(2)/m(2) year in order to influence the demand for buildings with a low impact on climate change. By applying this methodology to different case studies, we can conclude that obtaining the formula drastically simplifies the calculation of CO2 emissions in KgCO(2)/m(2) year. The results obtained from applying this methodology will serve to record CO2 emission rates in single-family houses on a yearly basis, thus contributing to the study of applications that address climate change mitigation.

ID INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CONSTRUCTION; QUANTIFICATION
AB This paper has changed the vague understanding that "the short-lived buildings have huge environmental footprints (EF)" into a concrete one. By estimating the annual floor space of buildings demolished and calibrating the average building lifetime in China, this paper compared the EF under various assumptive extended buildings' lifetime scenarios based on time-series environmental-extended input-output model. Results show that if the average buildings' lifetime in China can be extended from the current 23.2 years to their designed life expectancy, 50 years, in 2011, China can reduce 5.8 Gt of water withdrawal, 127.1 Mtce of energy consumption, and 426.0 Mt of carbon emissions, each of which is equivalent to the corresponding annual EF of Belgium, Mexico, and Italy. These findings will urge China to extend the lifetime of existing and new buildings, in order to reduce the EF from further urbanization. This paper also verifies that the lifetime of a product or the replacement rate of a sector is a very important factor that influences the cumulative EF. When making policies to reduce the EF, adjusting people's behaviors to extend the lifetime of products or reduce the replacement rate of sectors may be a very simple and cost-effective option.

ID NATURAL VENTILATION; PERFORMANCE
AB The current trend of global warming is causing an increase of worldwide air-conditioning installations with associated growth of electricity consumption and related CO2 emissions. The application of passive cooling systems (PCSs) could represent an alternative solution, hence contributing to the reduction of global warming as set by the agreement reached amid 195 countries at the COP21 Conference. Among the several PCSs, a contemporary version of the Iranian wind tower is considered in this paper through its application in temperate-hot climate zones. Palermo, Italy, was chosen as a reference site, since its climate characteristics are similar to the ones of the Middle East areas where wind towers originated. A wind tower functions by catching wind from a higher altitude and directing it into the adjacent building with the aim of providing cooling and/or ventilation effect. The original wind tower had one or more openings facing all favourable wind directions. A model comprising a one-channel wind tower and a room attached to it was analysed. Its performance was assessed using a simulation software calculating the potential cooling energy reduction due to controlled natural ventilation. The effects of orientation, height, size and direction of inlet and outlet apertures were simulated and relevant results presented.

AB In order to reduce CO2 emissions in line with UK policy, existing UK homes need to be retrofitted to high thermal standards. A large proportion of these homes have traditional or aesthetically pleasing features which people are reluctant to compromise for the sake of thermal efficiency. A minority of such dwellings are protected by statute, but millions are not. There is a dearth of structured discussion on the issues owners of such homes face when planning thermal retrofits. This study begins with a literature review of sustainable development, heritage and aesthetics. It then reports the results of qualitative interviews with retrofitting owners of such homes in Cambridge, UK. It finds homeowners struggling to balance thermal issues against a range of heritage and aesthetic concerns which often overlap or clash. Homeowners develop their own logic in working these through, and their aesthetic convictions strongly influence what happens with retrofitting. The interviews suggest that concern for the heritage embodied in the housing stock can be one reason current policy does not always engage homeowners in retrofitting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Optimal insulation thickness (OIT), total cost, energy savingsandpayback period (PP) has been calculated by using air gap together with insulation materials in buildings located in Ankara. The analysis of the exhaust emission rate has been carried out by calculating the total outer wall surface area of buildings and populations in the province. In these analysis, natural gas and coal as fuel, extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), mineral wool and expanded polystyrene (EPS) as insulation material were used with four different thicknesses of air gap combinations at exterior walls of building (sandwich walls). Whennatural gas is used as fuel and 4 cm air gap is introduced to XPS as insulating material, optimal insulation thickness (OIT) reduces to 3.4 cm from 9.2 cm, payback period (PP) decrease from 1.509 to 1.320 years. This results in by 28% reduction in the total cost, while annual savings were significantly increased to 96% in m(2). When coal is used as fuel with the same insulation material parameters applied above, (OIT) reduces to 5.00 cm from 10.8 cm, payback period (PP) decrease from 1.426 to 1.292 years, which results in by 24% reduction in the total cost with an increase to 94% in m(2) for annual savings. According to our calculations based on total population and residential subscribers to electricity in 2014, CO(2)emissionrate for natural gas usage are found to be reduced by 82% when 4 cm insulating material with 4 cm air gap is used compared to building without insulation. When coal is used for heating, CO2 and SO2 emissions rates are calculated to be reduced by 82%.

AB While many countries have set ambitious targets for reducing energy use and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, it remains highly uncertain whether the policies introduced will be suitable to reach these targets at the specified times. Models used to inform building policies often do not account for the different boundary conditions related to socio-economic development, climate, composition and age structure of the existing building stock, and lifetime expectancy, which hinders effective strategy development and realistic target setting. This study presents a dynamic Type-Cohort-Time (TCT) stock-driven modelling approach that considers demographic aspects, lifestyle-related issues, and building-specific characteristics. Case studies were conducted for the dwelling stocks in Germany and the Czech Republic, two countries with different boundary conditions, but that are sheltered under the same European energy reduction policies and goals. The effects of the policies on nearly zero energy buildings and increased renovation rates were tested. The results showed that current regulations are sufficient to achieve the 20% energy efficiency goal by 2020, but not to reach the 2050 energy and GHG-emission goals. The scenarios further demonstrate that the same policies on renovation and construction in different countries lead to different energy reduction levels. Accordingly, country-specific policies and measures are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The building sector significantly impacts on the environment during every stage of the building life cycle. The necessary transition toward a carbon-neutral society is driving a growing attention toward the refurbishment of old buildings, fostering intervention measures with the twofold objective of reducing operational energy consumption, typically upgrading the thermal insulation, and ensuring the quality of the consumed energy by adopting renewable and sustainable energy in the supply chain, such as thermal and photovoltaic solar energy.
   In seismic prone areas the vulnerability of existing buildings, not designed according to modern building codes, could hamper the efficiency of the solely energy refurbishment, besides representing a safety hazard. The present paper investigates a framework to quantify the influence of seismic events on the environmental impact assessment of buildings.
   The investigated framework is applied to a selected building, considering the building as alternatively located in regions with different seismicity. As an example, the building environmental impact is evaluated, in terms of carbon footprint, in the case of two different scenarios: upon completion of an energy refurbishment only, and after a coupled intervention targeting energy refurbishment and seismic retrofit. The results show that, in case of energy refurbishment only, the building located in a high-seismicity region presents an expected additional annual embodied equivalent carbon dioxide due to seismic risk, which almost equals the annual operational carbon dioxide after thermal refurbishment.

AB This paper presents the energy and water use of 4 social houses certified to the Code for Sustainable Homes Level 5 in Gainsborough, UK. The houses were monitored over 2 years, from July 2012 to September 2014. As the houses have the same construction and energy efficiency characteristics, the study offered a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of occupant behaviour on the dwellings performance. Electricity, gas and water consumptions were measured through data logging and meter readings. Surveys and interviews were conducted throughout to gain insights into tenants understanding and interactions with low energy features in their homes. Significant differences were observed in the amount of energy and water used. The annual space heating consumptions differentiated by a factor of 2.2 per square metre of floor area. Hot water heating demands varied by a factor of 3.5 per square metre of floor area or by 2.5 per person per year. Mains water consumptions varied by a factor of 2.2 litres per person per day in 2013.

AB A CO2 emission in construction materialization stage is the key research point of architectural life cycle assessment, which is concentrated in emission time and in absolute emission Volume. To build a calculation model for CO2 emissions in the materialization stage of office buildings, it should take into consideration the CO2 emissions generated from production and transportation of construction materials and equipment as well as the CO2 emissions generated from the construction process. By this calculation model, the CO2 emissions are analyzed and calculated of 78 office buildings in construction materialization stage. On average, the CO2 emissions in construction materialization stage are 326.75 kg - CO2/m(2) 111; with the increase of building height, CO2 emissions per unit area increase significantly and the CO2 emissions per unit area of super-high-rise buildings are 1.5 times that of the multi-storey buildings; the CO2 emissions of Civil Engineering account for 75% of the whole construction materialization stage; And the carbon emissions of steel, concrete, mortar and wall materials reach over 80% of the Civil Engineering. The storeys of the building and the consumption of construction materials are taken as two independent variables to set up a prediction model for CO2 emissions of office buildings in materialization stage. By statistical analysis and comparison, it can be found that the prediction formula using steel reinforcement, concrete and wall materials as independent variables can better predicate CO2 emissions in the construction materialization stage.

AB In support of its ambitious target to reduce CO2 emissions the Scottish Government is aiming to have the equivalent of 100% of Scottish electricity consumption generated from renewable sources by 2020. This is, at least in part, motivated by an expectation of subsequent employment growth in low carbon and renewable energy technologies; however there is no official data source to track employment in these areas. This has led to a variety of definitions, methodologies and alternative estimates being produced. Building on a recent study (Bishop and Brand, 2013) we develop a "hybrid" approach which combines the detail of "bottom-up" surveys with "top-down" trend data to produce estimates on employment in Low Carbon Environmental Goods and Services (LCEGS). We demonstrate this methodology to produce estimates for such employment in Scotland between 2004 and 2012. Our approach shows how survey and official sources can combine to produce a more timely measure of employment in LCEGS activities, assisting policymakers in tracking, consistently, developments. Applying our approach, we find that over this period employment in LCEGS in Scotland grew, but that this was more volatile than aggregate employment, and in particular that employment in this sector was particularly badly hit during the great recession.

AB Cities currently covering only a very small portion ( < aEuro-3aEuro-%) of the world's land surface directly release to the atmosphere about 44aEuro-% of global energy-related CO2, but they are associated with 71-76aEuro-% of CO2 emissions from global final energy use. Although many cities have set voluntary climate plans, their CO2 emissions are not evaluated by the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) procedures that play a key role for market- or policy-based mitigation actions. Here we analyze the potential of a monitoring tool that could support the development of such procedures at the city scale. It is based on an atmospheric inversion method that exploits inventory data and continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements from a network of stations within and around cities to estimate city CO2 emissions. This monitoring tool is configured for the quantification of the total and sectoral CO2 emissions in the Paris metropolitan area (similar to aEuro-12 million inhabitants and 11.4aEuro-TgC emitted in 2010) during the month of January 2011. Its performances are evaluated in terms of uncertainty reduction based on observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). They are analyzed as a function of the number of sampling sites (measuring at 25aEuro-maEuro-a.g.l.) and as a function of the network design. The instruments presently used to measure CO2 concentrations at research stations are expensive (typically similar to aEuro-EURaEuro-50aEuro-k per sensor), which has limited the few current pilot city networks to around 10 sites. Larger theoretical networks are studied here to assess the potential benefit of hypothetical operational lower-cost sensors. The setup of our inversion system is based on a number of diagnostics and assumptions from previous city-scale inversion experiences with real data. We find that, given our assumptions underlying the configuration of the OSSEs, with 10 stations only the uncertainty for the total city CO2 emission during 1 month is significantly reduced by the inversion by similar to aEuro-42aEuro-%. It can be further reduced by extending the network, e.g., from 10 to 70 stations, which is promising for MRV applications in the Paris metropolitan area. With 70 stations, the uncertainties in the inverted emissions are reduced significantly over those obtained using 10 stations: by 32aEuro-% for commercial and residential buildings, by 33aEuro-% for road transport, by 18aEuro-% for the production of energy by power plants, and by 31aEuro-% for total emissions. These results indicate that such a high number of stations would be likely required for the monitoring of sectoral emissions in Paris using this observation-model framework. They demonstrate some high potential that atmospheric inversions can contribute to the monitoring and/or the verification of city CO2 emissions (baseline) and CO2 emission reductions (commitments) and the advantage that could be brought by the current developments of lower-cost medium precision (LCMP) sensors.

AB Within the general context of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction, decomposition analysis allows the quantification of the contribution of different factors to changes in emissions as well as the assessment of the effectiveness of policy and technology measures. The Kaya identity has been widely used for that purpose in order to disaggregate carbon emissions into various driving forces. In this paper, it is applied for the analysis of emissions resulting from energy use at three different scales. First, a decomposition analysis of the carbon emissions for the complete Swiss energy system is presented using the future projections from the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050. The Kaya identity is then applied to the Swiss building sector after it is adapted with factors that are more relatable to building parameters, such as floor area instead of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Finally, the last level of analysis is a small scale community energy system for a unique Swiss village that aims to significantly reduce its emissions. An energy strategy is developed and its effectiveness is assessed with the adapted Kaya identity and benchmarked against the Swiss average values. The presented method demonstrates how the performance of buildings under various retrofitting scenarios can be benchmarked against future emission targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID USE ENERGY-CONSUMPTION
AB An assessment of residential CO2 emissions is typically performed through the intensity method, in which total energy consumption is estimated by multiplying floor space by intensity value. Although spatially detailed intensity data is required for an accurate estimation, the finer spatial resolution will result in a less stable estimated value due to the small sample size; hence, existing studies in Japan created intensity data at a regional or prefectural level. The objective of this study is to create municipality level intensity data via a statistical approach, using the household level micro data from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, by focusing on electricity. First, this study builds several (spatial) statistical models, where per household electricity expenditure is regressed on housing types (two categories), household types (seven categories), and other household specific variables. Second, by substituting averaged municipality level explanatory variables from official statistics into the model, it estimates municipality level intensity data. The obtained results suggest that conventional intensity data in Japan, created by the simple average of samples in each unit (prefecture), may suffer from an upward bias, suggesting a danger of overestimation of residential CO2 emissions.

AB Over the recent decades, China's building energy consumption has been growing rapidly. Also the fuel mix has been changing quickly with more natural gas 81 electricity and less coal being used. Meanwhile, the technologies used in building sector are improving in efficiency. In this paper, the impact of technical progress and the use of renewable energy in building sector are analyzed. The energy saving and emission reduction potential of building sector are also measured. China TIMES model is used to model the future energy consumption and carbon emissions in building sector. The modelling results indicate that building energy consumption is expected to grow to around 41.6EJ in the reference scenario in 2050. The energy saving potential in 2050 can be up to 4EJ due to the improvement of both building insulation (envelop) and energy use technologies. Renewable energy used in buildings can be a great contributor to the carbon mitigation in buildings. China's building sector can reach a relatively low-carbon future with more low- and non-carbon fuels consumed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the last decades, increasing attention has been paid to the enhancement of energy performance and comfort conditions of historic buildings, where the necessity to preserve architectural heritage does not allow typical invasive retrofit interventions. The need for a replicable methodology for improving the sustainability of historic buildings based on the integration of energy efficiency solutions with renewable technologies is here addressed, by riding over the constraints imposed by architectural preservations, rather taking advantage of heritage architectural peculiarities. The case study is represented by Palazzo Gallenga Stuart, a historical university building located in central Italy. The optimization of the building energy efficiency has been pursued through two strategies specifically prototyped for application in historic buildings, i.e. innovative cool tiles with the same appearance of traditional historic tiles, and a geothermal heat pump system with water storage tanks positioned in the under-ground unoccupied areas of the building previously used as archives, also preventing the use of external units spoiling the building facade. Four retrofit scenarios were analyzed and compared from a both technical and economical point of view. The results showed that the application of the innovative cool tiles lead to a maximum cooling energy saving of 14.0% and 3.8% in the classrooms of the top floor and in the whole building, respectively. Furthermore, the installation of a more effective energy plant leads to an average energy saving of 64.3% and 67.0% in terms of heating and cooling demand, respectively. The combination of the two effects leads to an average energy saving of 64.0% for heating and 69.2% for cooling. Additionally, the cost-benefit analysis showed a payback time of 5 years. This work shows the important environmental benefit achievable by researching around smart and innovative integrated systems for energy saving in historic buildings having a great potential in reducing energy demand and carbon emissions, in ancient European countries in particular.

AB The rapid pace of urbanisation comes with considerable environmental implications including pressures on already stressed limited water resources. In urban areas, most of the water use is associated with water consumption in buildings. The second largest use of water is via taps. It is often assumed that water taps with low flow rates can contribute to reduced per capita water consumption. However, this is based on very little evidence. This paper presents the synthesis of a 13,000 high resolution observations made to investigate the actual water consumption of innovative (water saving) electronic taps and conventional mixer taps. High resolution flow-meters and data loggers were fitted into two washrooms in two different buildings of a higher education institution to record the water use through the basin taps. The recorded data provided information on duration, frequency of use and volume of water consumption per use. The data was helpful in identifying trends in hot and cold water use and therefore can be useful in estimating energy for producing hot water and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Analysis of the observed data suggests that the low flow taps have greater mean water consumption per event than the conventional taps and water consumption is more influenced by user behaviour rather than the technology.

AB Buildings are responsible for more than 40% of global energy usage and as much as 33% of global greenhouse gas emissions in both developed and developing countries. However, the study of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4% of the total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction stage accounted for 12.6% of the total carbon emissions. Approximately 2% of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage. Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings. However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use phase.

AB The aim of the study presented in this paper is the comparison of different possibilities to reduce the power consumption and environmental impact of barrack buildings of the US army. For this purpose different building standards, different heating and cooling appliances and a cold storage concept are compared using annual building simulations. These simulations are carried out for central and northern locations in the US. The focus of this paper is the applicability of cold climate heat pumps in these climates. A coupled building and appliance model has been established to allow a fair comparison based on first energy usage and CO2 emissions. Altogether seven different building configurations in six different locations have been investigated. Simulation results show the most significant energy savings (up to 90%) can be achieved by improving building insulation and heat recovery of the ventilation system. Second major improvement is the usage of two-stage heat pump systems, which drastically reduces the need for backup heating systems and lead to seasonal efficiencies (SCOPs) in the area of 3.0, or in other words an energy saving of 20-35%. Thermal storage and control concepts such as night setback in comparison show little effect. The simulation results also showed that primary energy demand or greenhouse gas emissions are better measures for the comparison of environmental impact than COP and SCOP.

AB This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50% to 80% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45% to 60% in emissions and from 25% to 50% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14% and 44% higher than today. For an-economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23% in emissions, 36% in primary energy and 11% in costs. We identified close to 15% in emissions and 20% in primary energy savings with variable costs between -2% and 23% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts.

AB In the European Union, the building sector accounts for more than 40% of the total energy consumption and environmental impacts, representing the area with the greatest potential for intervention. In addition to the existing policies that promote energy efficiency in buildings, the embodied energy and the environmental impacts contained in the building materials should be considered. In the case of the construction of insulation facade systems, the environmental implications are different depending on the type of facade system, the insulation materials used and the location of the building. This article aims to provide all of this information for Spain, including not only the production of the components of the facade system but also the installation phase and the transport to the building site. The results show that the most impactful alternative is the ventilated facade combined with the most impactful insulation materials of stone wool and expanded polystyrene. Meanwhile, the most advisable facade in all of the climate zones is the external thermal insulation system combined with any type of insulation. The environmental impacts of insulation materials are very different. Moreover, it is recommended that further studies complete these results with the economic and social implications of the use and maintenance phases for robust decision-making. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Commercial photovoltaic system design for Cardiff City Hall
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENERGY

DT Article

AB The rooftops of Cardiff City Hall were surveyed to establish potential areas for commercial-scale photovoltaic (PV) system design. The orientation and tilt angles of suitable unshaded roof areas were measured for accurate PV system simulation. The performance of two PV technologies, polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) and heterojunction with intrinsic thin layers (HIT) was investigated. From the analysis of simulation, experimental, environmental and economic data, HIT was found to be the best-performing PV technology for system installation. Superior performance of HIT under diffuse sunlight conditions, typical of the UK climate, was demonstrated. Additionally, the maximum power temperature coefficient, verified during experimental work, was lower than the p-Si alternative (-0.28 against -0.50%/degrees C). Electricity demand data for City Hall were analysed and 8.1% of the annual electricity demand (solar fraction) could be supplied by an 88 kWp HIT PV system. The HIT PV system modelled would significantly improve the energy performance of Cardiff City Hall, avoiding >40 000 kg carbon dioxide emissions annually. The levelised cost of energy from one array (B, 0.11 pound/kWh) was less than the current day tariff rate for grid import (0.1173) pound. The economic and environmental benefits of well-designed high-efficiency PV systems in the UK at commercial scale are also demonstrated.

AB This paper aims to comparatively analyze the carbon reduction potential of several low carbon technologies by means of different assessment and planning methods for regional development. Seven commonly used building energy saving technologies are evaluated and the priority-setting among them is identified on the example of the building sector in Chongming Island, Shanghai. By applying Decoupiing Theory, the CO2 emission reduction extent under a low carbon scenario and an ideal scenario are estimated for 2030. The required application areas for different technology schemes are calculated using the Technology Combination Planning Method. In order to further find out required application areas for each technology under the least costs, the Goal Programming Method is then applied. Findings of the Technology Combination Planning Method reveal that the combination of energy saving technologies with high GHG emission reduction such as building insulation and geothermal heat pump have obvious effect in helping reducing the required technology application area. Goal Programming provides results for the required application area of each technology, and the minimum emission reduction cost is found as 2.54 x 10(8) US dollar under low carbon scenario and 3.50 x 10(8) US dollar under ideal scenario.

ID EXPLORATION
AB Due to the rapidly increasing percentage of the population living in urban centres, there is a need to focus on the energy demand of these cities and the use of renewable energies instead of fossil fuels. In this paper, we develop a spatial model to determine the potential per parcel for using shallow geothermal energy, for space heating and hot water. The method is based on the space heating and hot water energy demand of each building and the specific heat extraction potential of the subsurface per parcel. With this information, along with the available space per parcel for boreholes, the percentage of the energy demand that could be supplied by geothermal energy is calculated. The potential reduction in CO2 emissions should all possible geothermal energy be utilised, is also calculated. The method is applied to Ludwigsburg, Germany. It was found that CO2 emissions could potentially be reduced by 29.7% if all space heating and hot water requirements were provided by geothermal energy, which would contribute to the sustainability of a city. The method is simple in execution and could be applied to other cities as the data used should be readily available. Another advantage is the implementation into the web based Smart City Energy platform which allows interactive exploration of solutions across the city. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The European Union has an ambitious plan to reduce energy use and emissions by the year 2030. The building and real estate sectors have a great potential to help reduce emissions by energy efficiency. However, different energy sources and environmental standards affect the decision making of these major renovations in the existing stock. This study investigates how different renovation strategies affect the energy rating of a selected Building Environmental Assessment Tool and analyses the consequences in terms of greenhouse gas emissions for the local district heating system. Both building energy simulations and energy systems cost optimization were used to determine the energy use and local emissions. The results of different renovation scenarios were used to evaluate the rating in the selected tool and the impact in the district heating local emissions. The used methodology illustrates how energy efficient renovation impacts on the district heating system's local emissions. However, a bias towards resource classification within the Swedish Building Environmental Tool, Miljobyggnad, needs to be addressed in order to assess the impact of local emissions.

AB This paper demonstrates the possibility of converting a public building from inefficient energy consumer into a net-zero energy building (NZEB). This task is achieved through cost effective energy efficient measures (EEMs) and integration of solar energy systems. Three scenarios that utilize the same roof area are proposed to convert the building into NZEB. The first two scenarios use only PV system with the second scenario that incorporates replacing current chillers with more efficient chillers while the third scenario combines both PV and solar cooling systems. The first scenario attains NZEB on annual basis only whereas the other scenarios achieve NZEB on both annual and monthly basis. The second scenario has distinct advantages over other scenarios with respect to energy saving, interaction with energy grids and economic consideration.
   Both implemented and proposed EEMs result in about 1480 MW h saving of the building consumption and about 1021 ton avoided CO2 emission annually with payback periods ranging from half to 3 years for the considered measures. Annual avoided CO2 emission of about 748 ton is achieved for first or second scenario and about 848 ton for third scenario with payback periods 14.1,11.8 and 15 years for the 3 considered scenarios, respectively.

AB Residential buildings are the vast majority of the building sector and play a significant role in the energy and environmental footprint of the whole building stock. This paper presents an overview of the energy performance of the existing Hellenic residential building stock, by exploiting data from the EPCs (energy performance certificates) of buildings issued in accordance to national EPBD (energy performance in buildings directive) provisions. The analysis is performed for different building size (i.e. single- and multi-family houses), construction periods and locations (i.e. at the four national climate zones). In addition, implemented energy conservation measures are investigated in order to define the most common refurbishment actions for each building type. According to 650,000 EPCs that have been issued in Greece by August 2015,15% are for single-family houses and 85% for multi-family houses (buildings or building units). About 34% of the residential buildings are ranked at the lowest energy class-G, while only 3% are ranked in energy class-B or higher. The average calculated primary energy is 261.6kWh/m(2) and the average CO2 emissions 70.3 kg/m(2). Replacing the windows is the most popular retrofit action, followed by the installation of solar collectors for domestic hot water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the dry matter losses and the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations within two short rotation coppice (SRC) willow wood chip storage heaps. One heap was built on a grassland area (East Midlands) and the other (Rothamsted) on a concrete hard standing. A series of 1- and 3-m probes were embedded in the heaps in order to retrieve gas samples for analysis, and pre-weighed net bags were positioned in the core of the heap to detect dry matter losses. The bagged samples showed dry matter losses of 18 and 19 % in the East Midlands and Rothamsted heaps after 210 and 97 days storage, respectively. The Rothamsted heap showed a whole-heap dry matter loss of 21 %. During this time, the wood chips dried from 54 to 39 % moisture content in the East Midlands heap and 50 to 43 % at Rothamsted. The results from analysing the whole Rothamsted heap indicated an overall loss of 1.5 GJ per tonne stored, although measurements from bagged samples in the core suggested that the chips dried sufficiently to have a minimal energy loss from storage. The process of mixing the heap, however, led to incorporation of wet outer layers and hence the average moisture content was higher in an average sample of chip. After establishment of the heaps, the temperature rose rapidly and this correlated with a peak in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration within the heap. A peak in methane (CH4) concentration was also detected in both heaps, though more noticeably in the East Midlands heap after around 55 days. In both instances, the peak CH4 concentration occurred as CO2 concentrations dropped, suggesting that after an active period of aerobic decomposition in the first 2 months of storage, the conditions in the heap became anaerobic. The results from this study suggest that outside wood chip storage is not an efficient method of storing biomass, though this may be location-specific as there are some studies showing lower dry matter losses. It is necessary to explore other methods of harvesting SRC to minimise losses and optimise land use efficiency. Further research is required to detect whether there are fugitive emissions of CH4 from wood chip heaps, as this will compromise the net GHG savings from utilising the biomass stored in this way.

AB More than 44% of building energy consumption in the USA is used for space heating and cooling, and this accounts for 20% of national CO2 emissions. This prompts the need to identify among the 130 million households in the USA those with the greatest energy-saving potential and the associated costs of the path to reach that goal. Whereas current solutions address this problem by analysing each building in detail, we herein reduce the dimensionality of the problem by simplifying the calculations of energy losses in buildings. We present a novel inference method that can be used via a ranking algorithm that allows us to estimate the potential energy saving for heating purposes. To that end, we only need consumption from records of gas bills integrated with a building's footprint. The method entails a statistical screening of the intricate interplay between weather, infrastructural and residents' choice variables to determine building gas consumption and potential savings at a city scale. We derive a general statistical pattern of consumption in an urban settlement, reducing it to a set of the most influential buildings' parameters that operate locally. By way of example, the implications are explored using records of a set of (N = 6200) buildings in Cambridge, MA, USA, which indicate that retrofitting only 16% of buildings entails a 40% reduction in gas consumption of the whole building stock. We find that the inferred heat loss rate of buildings exhibits a power-law data distribution akin to Zipf's law, which provides a means to map an optimum path for gas savings per retrofit at a city scale. These findings have implications for improving the thermal efficiency of cities' building stock, as outlined by current policy efforts seeking to reduce home heating and cooling energy consumption and lower associated greenhouse gas emissions.

AB A ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) system used to provide the space heating for an office room is a renewable, high performance technology. This paper discusses vapour compression-based HP systems, briefly describing the thermodynamic cycle calculations, as well as the coefficient of performance (COP) and CO2 emissions of a HP with an electro-compressor and compares different heating systems in terms of energy consumption, thermal comfort and environmental impact. It is focused on an experimental study performed to test the energy efficiency of the radiator or radiant floor heating system for an office room connected to a GCHP. The main performance parameters (COP and CO2 emissions) are obtained for one month of operation of the GCHP system, and a comparative analysis of these parameters is presented. Additionally, two numerical simulation models of useful thermal energy and the system COP in heating mode are developed using the Transient Systems Simulation (TRNSYS) software. Finally, the simulations obtained from TRNSYS software are analysed and compared to the experimental data, showing good agreement and thus validating the simulation models.

ID PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION
AB One of the key drivers that influence building energy consumption is the demand for space heating. Particularly in countries with cold climates and a large stock of residential buildings with central heating, building energy management systems (BEMS) are an option to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These systems can be combined with existing space heating technologies and other efficiency measures, such as building insulation. They are ideal for retrofitting purposes owing to their low up-front costs. A prospective life cycle assessment model is used to analyze the environmental impacts of the technology today, in 2030, and in 2050. This allows for a first-ever, order-of-magnitude assessment of the environmental impacts of BEMS over their life cycle. The assessment is based on manufacturer information and generic life cycle inventory data for electronic components. Future impacts are based on changes in electricity generation following the International Energy Agency's 2 degree and 6 degree scenarios, and are used to assess the contribution of BEMS to global energy and GHG saving goals. Results show substantially lower life cycle GHG emissions and higher savings of environmental impacts per kilowatt-hour of heating when compared to natural gas or electric heating. Potential net emissions savings range from approximately 0.4 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2-eq) when avoiding natural gas heating to over 1 kg CO2-eq when avoiding electric heating in regions with GHG-intensive electricity generation. At present, BEMS can avoid at least 40 times the GHG emissions that they require for production and use, when deployed in regions with cold climates.

AB The building sector is a major contributor to energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and depletion of natural resources. In developed countries, existing buildings represent the majority of the stock, their low-carbon refurbishment hence being one of the most sensible ways to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce environmental impacts of the construction sector. This article has investigated and established the GHG and non-GHG life cycle impacts of several double skin facade (DSF) configurations for office refurbishments by means of a parametric comparative life cycle assessment against up-to-standard single skin facade (SSF) refurbishment solutions. Two different methods were used to assess both GHG emissions and other environmental impacts. Results show that if, on the one hand, most of the DSF configurations assessed actually reduce GHG emissions compared to SSFs over their life cyclethus supporting a wider adoption of DSFs for low-carbon refurbishmentson the other hand, there exist non-negligible ecological and environmental impacts that the DSF generates, specifically in terms of some materials of the structure and their final disposal. Research attention is thus needed regarding the environmental impacts of the materials used for DSFs and not only in minimizing the energy consumption of the operational phase.

AB Buildings are responsible for serious negative environmental impacts caused by their excessive energy and resource consumption, which all contribute to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. Many governments have thus implemented energy-saving strategies and technologies for both new and existing buildings since buildings have long life spans. Energy efficient building practices can minimize negative environmental impacts and improve economic growth and social prosperity, but although the use of energy efficient methods for new buildings is now widely accepted in South Korea, they are seldom implemented for the renovation of existing buildings. Here we report the development of a highly efficient Energy-efficient Remodeling Framework (ERF) to facilitate the implementation of energy saving strategies and technologies for existing buildings. It covers every stage of the project, from the initial identification of an energy-efficient building to its eventual Operation and Maintenance (O&M), focusing specifically on appropriate energy-saving strategies and technologies for existing buildings in South Korea. The ERF includes tools for energy-efficient renovation, including 'E-Scope', 'E-Ray', 'Impact Tables A&B', and 'E-Spectrum', that have been developed to support energy-efficient remodeling processes in South Korea. The new ERF framework can help government agencies and the construction industry to accelerate the process of expanding the energy efficient remodeling market and reduce energy consumption in the existing building stock and the associated carbon emissions, simultaneously improving the nation's energy security. The ERF will provide a useful national model for creating more energy efficient buildings and guide the creation of an energy-efficient remodeling policy in the Korean context.

AB This paper aims at assessing the value of load shifting and demand side flexibility for improving electric grid system operations. In particular, this study investigates to what extent residential heat pumps participating in load shifting can contribute to reducing operational costs and CO2 emissions associated with electric power generation and how home owners with heat pump systems can be best motivated to achieve these flexibility benefits. Residential heat pumps, when intelligently orchestrated in their operation, can lower operational costs and CO2 emissions by performing load shifting in order to reduce curtailment of electricity from renewable energy sources and improve the efficiency of dispatchable power plants. In order to study the interaction, both the electricity generation system and residences with heat pumps are modeled. In a first step, an integrated modeling approach is presented which represents the idealized case where the electrical grid operation in terms of unit commitment and dispatch is concurrently optimized with that of a large number of residential heat pumps located in homes designed to low-energy design standards. While this joint optimization approach does not lend itself for real-time implementation, it serves as an upper bound for the achievable operational cost savings. The main focus of this paper is to assess to what extent load shifting incentives are able to achieve the aforementioned savings potential. Two types of incentives are studied: direct load control and dynamic time-of-use pricing. Since both the electricity generation supply system and the residential building stock with heat pumps had been modeled for the joint optimization, the performance of both load shifting incentives can be compared by separately assessing the supply and demand side. Superior performance is noted for the direct-load control scenario, achieving 60-90% of the cost savings attained in the jointly optimized best-case scenario. In dynamic time-of-use pricing, poor performance in terms of reduced cost and emissions is noted when the heat pumps response is not taken into account. When the heat pumps response is taken into account, dynamic time-of-use pricing performs better. However, both dynamic time-of-use pricing schemes show inferior performance at high levels of residential heat pump penetration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Retrofitting the existing building stock is among the most important objectives and imperative to meet societal goals to reduce primary energy demand and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. District heating systems have proven to supply heat for buildings both energy and cost efficiently. Thermal microgrids (TMGs) can be understood as a subcategory of district heating systems: small scale, bidirectional, and potentially fed by different thermal sources. Given a suitable combination of loads, the number of and distance between buildings, they can offer economic and environmental advantages compared to the supply by individual heating systems per building. We present a novel method using data analysis techniques on georeferenced building stock data to identify suitable configurations of buildings that yield a cost-efficient TMG. For the identification, both semantic and spatial data from a database are combined using fuzzy logics and cost-benefit analysis. We apply the method using a case study featuring a database of 306 buildings potentially to be retrofitted. As a result, we can identify nine groups of 25 buildings that would form a microgrid featuring up to 17.4% cost benefits compared to an individual heat supply. This would save approximately 30% of the building-induced CO2 emission of the community.

AB Building sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide (up to 40% of the total global energy); moreover, by the year 2030 the consumption is expected to increase by 50%. One of the reasons is that the performance of buildings and its components degrade over the years. In recent years, energy benchmarking for government office buildings, large scale public buildings and large commercial buildings is one of the key energy saving projects for promoting the development of building energy efficiency and sustainable energy savings in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions and conventional air pollution. This paper focuses on energy benchmarking for shopping centers in Gulf Coast Region. In addition, this paper will analyze a sample of shopping centers data in Gulf Coast Region (Dubai, Ajman, Sharjah, Oman and Bahrain). It aims to develop a benchmark for these shopping centers by highlighting the status of energy consumption performance. This research will support the sustain ability movement in Gulf area through classifying the shopping centers into: Poor, Usual and Best Practices in terms of energy efficiency. According to the benchmarking analysis in this paper, the shopping centers best energy management practices in the Gulf Coast Region are the buildings that consume less than 810 kW h/m(2)/yr, whereas the poor building practices are the centers that consume greater than 1439 kW h/m(2)/yr. The conclusions of this work can be used as a reference for shopping centres benchmarking with similar climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cities play a vital role in the global climate change mitigation agenda. City population density is one of the key factors that influence urban energy consumption and the subsequent GHG emissions. However, previous research on the relationship between population density and GHG emissions led to contradictory results due to urban/rural definition conundrum and the varying methodologies for estimating GHG emissions. This work addresses these ambiguities by employing the City Clustering Algorithm (CCA) and utilizing the gridded CO2 emissions data. Our results, derived from the analysis of all inhabited areas in the US, show a sub-linear relationship between population density and the total emissions (i.e. the sum of on-road and building emissions) on a per capita basis. Accordingly, we find that doubling the population density would entail a reduction in the total CO2 emissions in buildings and on-road sectors typically by at least 42%. Moreover, we find that population density exerts a higher influence on on-road emissions than buildings emissions. From an energy consumption point of view, our results suggest that on-going urban sprawl will lead to an increase in on-road energy consumption in cities and therefore stresses the importance of developing adequate local policy measures to limit urban sprawl.

AB Improving energy efficiency in European Union buildings will require retrofitting much of the existing stock due to limited new construction opportunities. Given uncertainty in energy prices and technology costs stemming from deregulation, a stochastic optimisation framework is desirable for long-term decision support. We synthesise treatment of uncertainty and risk management to obtain insights about the impact of retrofits on energy consumption, costs, CO2 emissions, and risk at real buildings in Austria and Spain. The optimal strategy for the Spanish site is to invest in photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies. This lowers expected costs by 8.5% and reduces expected primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 20% relative to using existing equipment. By limiting exposure to volatile energy prices, the strategy also yields a nearly 10% reduction in risk. We obtain similar results also for the Austrian site. Via this framework, tradeoffs among competing objectives and the effectiveness of proposed regulation may be assessed. Specifically, we find that more stringent restrictions on energy efficiency are economically viable if regulation also facilitates enhanced operational decision support for buildings. Indeed, primary energy consumption can be lowered only through more on-site generation such as combined heat and power, which is more complex for building managers to deploy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Since the Industrial Revolution, the geographical extent of cities has increased around the world. In particular, following three decades of rapid regional economic growth, many Asian megacities have emerged and continue to expand, resulting in inevitable short-term urban redevelopment. In this region, the microclimatic impacts of urban redevelopment have not been extensively investigated using long-term in situ observations. In this study, changes in surface sensible heat exchange, heat storage, and anthropogenic heat emissions that are due to urban residential redevelopment were quantified and analyzed on the basis of a 3-yr micrometeorological record from the Seoul, South Korea, metropolitan area. The results show that, following urban redevelopment of compact high-rise residential buildings, 1) the daily minimum air temperature near the ground surface increased by; similar to 0.6 K; 2) the ratio between surface sensible heat and net radiation increased by from; similar to 9% (summer) to 31% (winter), anthropogenic heat emissions increased by from 7.6 (summer) to 23.6 (spring) Wm(-2), and daily maximum heat storage ranged from 35.1 (spring) to 54.5 (summer) Wm(-2); and 3) there was a transition of local circulation with changes in the surface properties of heat sources and roughness.

AB Energy efficiency and carbon reduction of new buildings are key objectives of policies that aim to decrease electric use nationwide, particularly during the summer, when electricity usage is at its highest. A case study was developed to test the energy-conservation performance and economic feasibility of the creative and intelligent open building "MEGA House". MEGA House focuses on making improvements in four key areas: (a) Material, (b) Electronic, (c) Green Building, and (d) Automation. This paper focuses on applications in the areas of Electronic and Green Building. The economic analysis in this paper of electricity consumption and of the potential energy-savings is based on the use of energy conservation equipment such as earth tubes and solar chimneys, situation simulations, field measurements at four experimental stages, and economic calculations.
   According to the results of measurement and economic analysis, the MEGA House demonstrated optimal energy conservation performance. Using an earth tube (fan) and a solar chimney (exhaust fans) in the MEGA House lowered the indoor temperature about 1 similar to 2 degrees C in summer, while using an earth tube (fan) instead of an electric heater increased the indoor temperature as much as 3-4 degrees C. In terms of economic benefits, the using the energy-conservation facilities installed in MEGA House reduced electricity expenditures by NT$8537.76 and decreased CO2 emissions by around 1288.83 kg per year.

TI Co-benefits and trade-offs in the water-energy nexus of irrigation

AB There are strong interdependencies between water use in agriculture and energy consumption as water saving technologies can require increased pumping and pressurizing. The Chinese Government includes water efficiency improvement and carbon intensity reduction targets in the 12th Five-Year Plan (5YP. 2011-2015), yet the links between energy use and irrigation modernization are not always addressed in policy targets. Here we build an original model of the energy embedded in water pumping for irrigated agriculture and its related processes. The model is based on the physical processes of irrigation schemes and the implication of technological developments, comprising all processes from extraction and conveyance of water to its application in the field. The model uses data from government sources to assess policy targets for deployment of irrigation technologies, which aim to reduce water application and contribute to adaptation of Chinese agriculture to climate change. The consequences of policy targets involve co-beneficial outcomes that achieve water and energy savings, or trade-offs in which reduced water application leads to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We analyze irrigation efficiency and energy use in four significant provinces and nationally, using scenarios based on the targets of the 12th 5YP. At the national scale, we find that expansion of sprinklers and micro-irrigation as outlined in the 5YP would increase GHG emissions from agricultural water use, however, emissions decrease in those provinces with predominant groundwater use and planned expansion of low-pressure pipes. We show that the most costly technologies relate to trade-offs, while co-benefits are generally achieved with less expensive technologies. The investment cost per area of irrigation technology expansion does not greatly affect the outcome in terms of water, but in terms of energy the most expensive technologies are more energy-intensive and produce more emissions. The results show that water supply configuration (proportion of surface to groundwater) largely determines the potential energy savings from reductions in water application. The paper examines the importance of fertigation and highlights briefly some policy implications.

AB With the pressing need to meet an ever-increasing energy demand, the combustion systems utilizing fossil fuels have been the major contributors to carbon footprint. As the combustion of conventional energy resources continue to produce significant Green House gas (GHG) emissions, there is a strong emphasis to either upgrade or find an energy-efficient eco-friendly alternative to the traditional hydrocarbon fuels. With recent developments in nanotechnology, the ability to manufacture materials with custom tailored properties at nanoscale has led to the discovery of a new class of high energy density fuels containing reactive metallic nanoparticles (NPs). Due to the high reactive interfacial area and enhanced thermal and mass transport properties of nanomaterials, the high heat of formation of these metallic fuels can now be released rapidly, thereby saving on specific fuel consumption and hence reducing GHG emissions. In order to examine the efficacy of nanofuels in energetic formulations, it is imperative to first study their combustion characteristics at the droplet scale that form the fundamental building block for any combustion system utilizing liquid fuel spray. During combustion of such multiphase, multicomponent droplets, the phenomenon of diffusional entrapment of high volatility species leads to its explosive boiling (at the superheat limit) thereby leading to an intense internal pressure build-up. This pressure upsurge causes droplet fragmentation either in form of a microexplosion or droplet puffing followed by atomization (with formation of daughter droplets) featuring disruptive burning. Both these atomization modes represent primary mechanisms for extracting the high oxidation energies of metal NP additives by exposing them to the droplet flame (with daughter droplets acting as carriers of NPs). Atomization also serves as a natural mechanism for uniform distribution and mixing of the base fuel and enhancing burning rates (due to increase in specific surface area through formation of smaller daughter droplets). However, the efficiency of atomization depends on the thermo-physical properties of the base fuel, NP concentration and type. For instance, at dense loading NP agglomeration may lead to shell formation which would sustain the pressure upsurge and hence suppress atomization thereby reducing droplet gasification rate. Contrarily, the NPs may act as nucleation sites and aid boiling and the radiation absorption by NPs (from the flame) may lead to enhanced burning rates. Thus, nanoadditives may have opposing effects on the burning rate depending on the relative dominance of processes occurring at the droplet scale. The fundamental idea in this study is to: First, review different thermo-physical processes that occur globally at the droplet and sub-droplet scale such as surface regression, shell formation due to NP agglomeration, internal boiling, atomization/NP transport to flame zone and flame acoustic interaction that occur at the droplet scale and second, understand how their interaction changes as a function of droplet size, NP type, NP concentration and the type of base fuel. This understanding is crucial for obtaining phenomenological insights on the combustion behavior of novel nanofluid fuels that show great promise for becoming the next-generation fuels.

TI Towards a green sustainable strategy for Mediterranean cities: Assessing

   Northern Greece, using environmental modelling, GIS and very high
   spatial resolution remote sensing data

AB In the Mediterranean area, rural abandonment and the rapid urbanisation after the 1950's have led to complex environmental problems, such as the exploitation of natural resources, the environmental pollution and the rapid increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Especially the unrestrained urban growth caused excessive pressure on the existing infrastructure, which affects buildings, public transportation, road networks, water quality, waste collection and public health.
   Green roofs are emerging building technologies that can help communities mitigate some of the above mentioned problems. Various studies have demonstrated that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate some of these environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of heat losses through the building's envelope, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling as well as the effective management of the urban heat island effect.
   In this line of thought, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. To delineate the available green roof areas, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Potential green roof extent was extracted with a mean error of 8.78 m(2), and discriminated from staircases, penthouse setbacks and terracotta tiles. Subsequently GIS were used to extrapolate the results from the building to the city scale. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations.
   The green roof potential in Thessaloniki approximated 17% of the gross built areas of the city, which means that there is a strong potential for green roof retrofit. Depending on the vegetation type installed in an extensive green roof, C stocks in Thessaloniki can increase by 2.5 times, while the dynamic energy simulations suggested that in certain city blocks reduced heating and cooling consumptions up to 5% and 16% respectively could be achieved. In regard to rainwater retention, implementation of green roofs in Thessaloniki is estimated to contribute in rainwater retention by almost 45%, allowing more than half of the rainwater precipitation to be reserved at the 50% of the city blocks.

AB Rehabilitating a building is a unique opportunity to reach higher levels of environmental performance and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions required for its operation. In contrast to the activities of demolition and construction of new buildings, rehabilitation brings environmental and economic advantages. When applied to buildings with cultural significance, architectural rehabilitation also promotes an important social capital - the built heritage. However, rehabilitation activities have an environmental load in themselves. Even the interventions aiming to improve the performance of existing buildings can have a negative effect on the environment. The prospect of environmental indicators to evaluate the feasibility of architectural rehabilitation has been the focus of interest in this research. An extensive literature review on the subject addressed studies from the 1970s to the most recent works, finding that the concept of avoided environmental impact is a relevant approach. In this concept, the feasibility of rehabilitation can be determined from the comparison between the environmental impacts involved in the rehabilitation and use of an existing building and those arising from the demolition of a building followed by the construction and use of a new equivalent building. As for establishing indicators based on the concept of avoided impact, studies of excellence rely on life cycle assessments. The life cycle assessment is a unique method to assess the environmental performance of buildings and in decision making in building projects. Rehabilitated buildings have their usage value restored and their obsolescence reversed. The use value of a building can be determined in terms of environmental, social and economic indicators. To be effective in restoring the use value, the building rehabilitation should be feasible in those three aspects. The ability to demonstrate the environmental benefits in conserving buildings of cultural value brings new alternatives to preserve that heritage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Buildings are responsible for 40% of global energy use and contribute towards 30% of the total CO2 emissions. The drive to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the increasing installation of meters and sensors for monitoring energy use and indoor environmental conditions in buildings. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in building energy metering and environmental monitoring, including their social, economic, environmental and legislative drivers. The integration of meters and sensors with existing building energy management systems (BEMS) is critically appraised, especially with regard to communication technologies and protocols such as ModBus, M-Bus, Ethernet, Cellular, ZigBee, WiFi and BACnet. Findings suggest that energy metering is covered in existing policies and regulations in only a handful of countries. Most of the legislations and policies on energy metering in Europe are in response to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), 2002/91/EC. However, recent developments in policy are pointing towards more stringent metering requirements in future, moving away from voluntary to mandatory compliance. With regards to metering equipment, significant developments have been made in the recent past on miniaturisation, accuracy, robustness, data storage, ability to connect using multiple communication protocols, and the integration with BEMS and the Cloud - resulting in a range of available solutions, selection of which can be challenging. Developments in communication technologies, in particular in low-power wireless such as ZigBee and Bluetooth LE (BLE), are enabling cost-effective machine to machine (M2M) and internet of things (IoT) implementation of sensor networks. Privacy and data protection, however, remain a concern for data aggregators and end-users. The standardization of network protocols and device functionalities remains an active area of research and development, especially due to the prevalence of many protocols in the BEMS industry. Available solutions often lack interoperability between hardware and software systems, resulting in vendor lock-in. The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of available technologies for energy metering and environmental monitoring; their drivers, advantages and limitations; factors affecting their selection and future directions of research and development - for use a reference, as well as for generating further interest in this expanding research area.

   FOOTPRINT
AB To prepare for an urban influx of 2.5 billion people by 2050, it is critical to create cities that are low-carbon, resilient, and livable. Cities not only contribute to global climate change by emitting the majority of anthropogenic greenhouse gases but also are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme weather. We explore options for establishing sustainable energy systems by reducing energy consumption, particularly in the buildings and transportation sectors, and providing robust, decentralized, and renewable energy sources. Through technical advancements in power density, city-integrated renewable energy will be better suited to satisfy the high-energy demands of growing urban areas. Several economic, technical, behavioral, and political challenges need to be overcome for innovation to improve urban sustainability.

AB Being different from inventoried data, spatialized maps of carbon dioxide (CO2) flow at high resolution in urban areas are essential for carbon cycle research and carbon reduction management. In this research, Guangyuan, a mountainous city located in southwestern China, which was heavily affected by the 2008 earthquake, was used as a studying case. In this city, gridded data of vertical carbon flows at 1-km resolution was extracted based on point emission sources and other supporting data in Guangyuan. Among the 16,020 grids, 4,465 performed as CO2 emission sources while the other 11,555 as sinks. On the whole, Guangyuan City served as a carbon sink in 2010, with the total net flow of 0.44 Mt CO2 being sequestered and stored by vegetations. The overall pattern of emission sources and sinks matched well with local land-use patterns. The hotspots of CO2 emissions appeared in the built-up areas along local valleys, as well as low mountainous areas. On the contrary, large areas of carbon sinks were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas of northwest and northeast parts of Guangyuan. With regard to the distribution of gridded emissions, an evidently clustered characteristic was identified. The proportion of the largest individual emission grid accounted for 12.01% of the total emission. The cumulative percentage of gridded emissions indicated that supervision of 0.06% of the total area could enable effective management of approximately 60% of the total emissions in Guangyuan. Thus, the spatialized gridded data of carbon flows produced in this research can provide significant policy implications for urban planning and regional carbon flow mitigation.

AB There have been much interest and many efforts to control global warming and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the world. Recently, the Republic of Korea has also increased its GHG reduction goal and searched for an implementation plan. In buildings, for example, there have been technology developments and deployment policies to reduce GHG emissions from a life cycle perspective, covering construction materials, building construction, use of buildings and waste disposal. In particular, Korea's Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design is a certification of environmentally-friendly buildings for their energy saving and reduction of environmental pollution throughout their lives. In fact, the demand and adoption of the certification are rising every year. In construction materials and buildings, as a result, an environmentally-friendly aspect has become crucial. The importance of construction material and building development technologies that can reduce environmental load by diminishing GHG emissions in buildings has emerged. Moreover, there has been a rising necessity to verify the GHG reduction effects of buildings. To assess the reduction of carbon emissions in the buildings built with low-carbon construction technologies and materials, therefore, this study estimated life cycle carbon emissions in reference buildings in which general construction materials are used and in low-carbon buildings. For this, the carbon emissions and their reduction from construction materials (especially concrete) between conventional products and low-carbon materials were estimated, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). After estimating carbon emissions from a building life cycle perspective, their reduction in low-carbon buildings compared to the reference buildings was reviewed. The results found that compared to conventional buildings, low-carbon buildings revealed a 25% decrease in carbon emissions in terms of the reduction of Life Cycle CO2 (LCCO2) per unit area. If diverse production technologies and sales routes are further developed for low-carbon construction materials, carbon emission reduction effects would considerably increase.

AB Various tools that assess life cycle CO2 (LCCO2) emissions are currently being developed throughout the international community. However, most building LCCO2 emissions assessment tools use a bill of quantities (BOQ), which is calculated after starting a building's construction. Thus, it is difficult to assess building LCCO2 emissions during the early design phase, even though this capability would be highly effective in reducing LCCO2 emissions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a Building Simplified LCCO2 emissions Assessment Tool (B-SCAT) for application in the early design phase of low-carbon buildings in South Korea, in order to facilitate efficient decision-making. To that end, in the construction stage, the BOQ and building drawings were analyzed, and a database of quantities and equations describing the finished area were conducted for each building element. In the operation stage, the "Korea Energy Census Report" and the "Korea Building Energy Efficiency Rating Certification System" were analyzed, and three kinds of models to evaluate CO2 emissions were proposed. These analyses enabled the development of the B-SCAT. A case study compared the assessment results performed using the B-SCAT against a conventional assessment model based on the actual BOQ of the evaluated building. These values closely approximated the conventional assessment results with error rates of less than 3%.

AB Countless cities are rapidly developing across the globe, pressing the need for clear urban-planning and design recommendations geared toward sustainability. This paper examines the intersections of Jane Jacobs' four conditions for diversity with low-carbon and low-energy-use urban systems in four cities around the world: Lyon (France), Chicago (Illinois), Kolkata (India), and Singapore City (Singapore). After reviewing Jacobs' four conditions for diversity, the four cities are introduced and their historical development context is described. A framework to study the cities along the following three dimensions is then presented: population and density, infrastructure development/use, and climate and landscape. These cities differ in many respects and their analysis is instructive for many other cities around the globe. Jacobs' conditions are present in all of them, manifested in different ways and to varying degrees. Overall, the study results show that the adoption of Jacobs' conditions seems to align well with concepts of low-carbon urban systems, with their focus on walkability, transit-oriented design, and more efficient land use (i.e., smaller unit sizes). Transportation-sector emissions seem to demonstrate a stronger influence from the presence of Jacobs' conditions, whereas the link was less pronounced in the building sector. Kolkata, a low-income, developing world city, seems to possess many of Jacobs' conditions, while exhibiting low per-capita emissions-maintaining both of these during its economic expansion will take careful consideration. Greenhouse-gas mitigation, however, is inherently an in situ problem and the first task must therefore be to gain local knowledge of an area before developing strategies to lower its carbon footprint.

AB For energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction, renewable energy facilities, such as solar equipments and rooftop gardens, are considered effective for energy management of institutional buildings in a community. This study integrated an energy mixture facility model with a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II optimizer as a multiobjective optimal facility allocation model (MOFAM) for allocating renewable energy facilities on the rooftop of campus buildings.
   A case study was conducted on a college campus to demonstrate the feasibility of MOFAM. MOFAM offers simple steps and provides more allocation plans to satisfy decision-makers' requirements for minimum investment cost, maximum CO2 reduction, and maximum investment returns. In addition, the result demonstrates that the multiobjective optimal model considering three objectives resulted in optimal solutions that include the optimal solutions generated from two-objective optimization. In this campus case, MOFAM helped decision-makers optimize the installation area of solar photovoltaic panels, the installation area of solar water heaters, and the area of rooftop gardens on campus rooftops to perform effective management for institutional buildings for conserving energy and CO2 reduction.

AB The paper investigates the introduction of a solar heating and cooling system in an office building characterized by low energy demand with respect to the current national building stock and located in Southern Italy. Dynamic simulations are carried out in order to evaluate the thermo-economic performance of the analyzed system considering different solar panel technologies (flat plate and evacuated tube), tilt angles (10-70 degrees), collecting areas (30-60 m(2)), hot and cold storage sizes, reference emission factors, electricity and natural gas unitary prices. To satisfy cooling demand a small scale adsorption chiller activated by thermal energy available from solar collectors is considered.
   The solar heating and cooling system demonstrated primary energy saving and equivalent dioxide carbon emission reduction higher than 23% in comparison to the reference conventional system. The results show that the solar energy system will be competitive when the electricity and natural gas prices will be high and strong government incentives will be provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Building energy efficiency and urban waste management are two focal issues for improving environmental status and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The main aim of this paper is to compare economic costs of new building envelope structures designed by authors reusing and upcycling municipal waste in order to decrease energy demand from the building sector and, at the same time, improve eco-friendly waste management at the local scale. The reuse of waste for building envelope structures is one of the main principles of the Earthship buildings model, based on the use of passive solar principles in autonomous earth-sheltered homes. This Earthship principle has been analyzed in order to optimize buildings' energy performance and reuse municipal waste for new building envelope structures in urban areas. Indeed, the elaborated structures have been designed for urban contexts, with the aim of reuse waste coming from surrounding landfills. The methods include an analysis of thermal performance of urban waste for designing new building envelope structures realized by assembling waste and isolating materials not foreseen in Earthship buildings. The reused materials are: cardboard tubes, automobile tires, wood pallets, and plastic and glass bottles. Finally, comparing economic costs of these new building envelope structures, the obtained results highlight their economic feasibility compared to a traditional structure with similar thermal transmittance.

AB Analysis of the environmental impact of particular structures may be helpful for selecting building materials, with regard to the environmental performance of buildings in the early project phase. This paper focused on the environmental evaluation of building foundation materials used in eight masonry residential buildings. Environmental evaluation was based on calculation of the embodied energy, the global warming potential, and the acidification potential of building foundations. One kilogramme of built-in foundation materials was responsible for emissions of 0.092 kg of greenhouse gases expressed by carbon dioxide (CO2) and for 0.3 g of acidification gases represented by sulphur dioxide (SO2). Embodied energy was calculated as equal to 1.14 MJ per one kilogramme of foundation materials and 832.2 MJ/m(2) per building floor area. The foundation materials of houses contributed to the total environmental impact of the whole buildings by, on average, 15.0%, 22.8%, and 13.3% for embodied energy, global warming potential, and acidification potential, respectively.

AB The energy efficiency of the European building stock needs to be increased in order to fulfill the climate goals of the European Union. To be able to evaluate the impact of energy efficient refurbishment in matters of greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to apply a system perspective where not only the building but also the surrounding energy system is taken into consideration. This study examines the impact that energy efficient refurbishment of multi-family buildings has on the district heating and the electricity production. It also investigates the impact on electricity utilization and emissions of greenhouse gases. The results from the simulation of four energy efficiency building refurbishment packages were used to evaluate the impact on the district heating system. The packages were chosen to show the difference between refurbishment actions that increase the use of electricity when lowering the heat demand, and actions that lower the heat demand without increasing the electricity use. The energy system cost optimization modeling tool MODEST (Model for Optimization of Dynamic Energy Systems with Time Dependent Components and Boundary Conditions) was used. When comparing two refurbishment packages with the same annual district heating use, this study shows that a package including changes in the building envelope decreases the greenhouse gas emissions more than a package including ventilation measures.

AB Global warming has posed a great challenge to the survival of mankind. The increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is widely recognized as the largest contributor of global warming. Hence, world-wide attention towards energy conservation has grown markedly to reduce the carbon dioxide emission. In the context of building energy performance, the ancient wisdom of using the earth as temperature moderator against harsh weather has impressive potential to become a solid solution against the energy inefficiency of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning system (HVAC) in building. This creative and traditional passive cooling technique has been also made it possible to achieve most criteria of sustainable development concerning the world's growing housing demand, climate change, fossil-fuel depletion as well as limited land area and resources.
   In this paper, underground buildings were reviewed from preliminary aspects such as historical background, classification and subsequent thermal energy performance criteria. It has tried to elaborate the thermal performance variables, and conduct further study of benefits and drawbacks of this passive cooling technique toward different perspectives of sustainable development. With intention to gain wide acceptance in the modern society, this paper has proposed a conceptual design of earth sheltered home, which incorporated different types of the building techniques.
   Eventually earth sheltered buildings worldwide were summarized in a well illustrative form to highlight the different designs, applications, locations, timelines and climates. In addition, a deductive model is graphically represented for the virtual overview of underground structures that set the foundation to further investigate sustainability of this building envelope technique.

AB To achieve a low-carbon society, it is crucial to make the transition away from wasteful lifestyles that are shaped by mass production/mass consumption towards low-carbon lifestyles. Research in the field of urban environmental studies examining human behavioral factors affecting energy consumption, has mostly focused on CO2 emissions relating to direct energy consumption, such as the use of air conditioners and water heaters. As CO2 emissions from the industrial sector are greater than those from the residential and transportation sectors in Japan, it would be prudent for consumers to work on reducing CO2 emissions relating to products and services. In an effort to provide some basic research to achieve the aforementioned objectives, this study looked at statistical data from sources such as the Japanese Family Income and Expenditure Survey and the Japanese National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure to estimate direct and indirect CO2 emissions relating to daily expenditures and consumption. As a case study, we selected a sample denizen to calculate the CO2 emissions relating to daily living. Based on the obtained results, we examined the lifestyle and consumption patterns and their relation to CO2 emissions. The results suggest that while it is still important for consumers to reduce their direct energy consumption in an effort to create a low-carbon society, there is still potential for indirect CO2 emission reductions in areas of production and consumption.

AB Residential buildings play an important role in consumption of energy resources. About 40 % of all primary energy is used in buildings all over the world. This paper is the second part of the study on the life-cycle energy (LCEA), emissions (LCCO(2)A) and cost (LCCA) assessment of two residential buildings constructed in urban and rural areas.
   In the first part, the methodology, formulations and procedure for such a comprehensive analysis are provided, while this paper provides an application of the methodology that considers two actual buildings located in Gaziantep, Turkey. The proposed model focused on building construction, operation and demolition phases to estimate energy use, carbon emissions and costs per square meter over a 50-year lifespan. The optimum thickness of insulation used to reduce energy consumption and emissions per square meter is determined.
   It is found that the operating phase is dominant in both urban and rural residential buildings and contributes 87-85 % of the primary energy requirements and 88-82 % of CO2 emissions, respectively. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions were 5.8 and 3.9 tons CO2 eqv. for BT1 and BT2, respectively. It is calculated that the life-cycle energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the residential buildings can be reduced by up to 22.8 and 23.4 %, respectively, by using a proper insulation material for the external walls. The life-cycle cost, consisting of mortgage, energy, maintenance, service and demolition payments are calculated to be 7.28 and 1.72 million USD for BT1 and BT2, respectively.
   Building envelope developments, such as better wall insulation, provide noteworthy potential energy savings and contribute to the reductions from cooling and space heating. Therefore, primary strategies and technologies needed for efficient buildings include optimal insulation of external walls. The economic insulation thickness of the residential buildings in Gaziantep is determined to be 80 mm by using a life-cycle cost analysis. The results show that because of the differences in building structures and living standards, life-cycle energy intensity and CO2 emissions in urban residential buildings are 29 and 25 % higher than in rural conditions.

TI German Energiewende and the heating market - Impact and limits of policy

ID BUILDING STOCK; DECISIONS; OPTIONS
AB The German Energiewende envisages achieving a climate-neutral building stock in 2050 by means of two major pillars of regulation. First, residential buildings should consume 80% less primary energy and second; the remaining energy demand should be covered primarily with renewables. This paper simulates the future German heating market under different policy scenarios in order to evaluate the impact and limits of recent and conceivable policies. The investigation is based upon a dual model approach, linking a residential heating model to a discrete choice model. The major finding is that current regulations are not suitable for the achievement of governmental targets. Scenario calculations show that additional carbon emission reductions, triggered by the current regulatory regime, are falling short of expectations. In terms of economic efficiency, all calculated policy alternatives outperform the regulation currently in place. This allows to draw the conclusion that carbon emission reductions can be achieved without a major increase in cost. The model results highlight two policy implications. First, a rising mandatory share of renewables in the heating market is needed for target achievement and can be cost effectively. Second, renewable obligations for heating systems must include the existing building stock to achieve the postulated political targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within the last few years, the increase of the world's energy consumption has substantially impacted the environment. Solar energy initiative is more than ever involved to tackle this issue, especially when deploying PV (photovoltaic) systems over large-scale residential areas. However, not all surfaces in these areas are economically suitable, while some surfaces have low CO2 mitigation. With the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data, the estimation of suitable rooftops for PV systems installation can be performed automatically by estimating the PV potential. This paper presents a novel method for estimating NPV (net present value) of the potential PV systems installed on rooftops by using LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and PV systems' nonlinear efficiency characteristics. More importantly, the environmental impact is estimated for each rooftop through EPBT (energy payback time) and GGER (greenhouse gas emission rate), based on the life-cycle of a specific PV system. This is combined with NPV in order to find rooftops that are both economically and environmentally viable candidates for PV systems deployment. Results demonstrate a case study LiDAR data for predicting each building's economical and environmental impact, as well as providing an overall view of resulting cumulative CO2 mitigation over large residential area.

AB The capture and separation of traces and concentrated CO2 from important commodities such as CH4, H-2, O-2 and N-2, is becoming important in many areas related to energy security and environmental sustain ability. While trace CO2 concentration removal applications have been modestly studied for decades, the spike in interest in the capture of concentrated CO2 was motivated by the need for new energy vectors to replace highly concentrated carbon fuels and the necessity to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. CO2 capture from various gas streams, at different concentrations, using physical adsorbents, such as activated carbon, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), is attractive. However, the adsorbents must be designed with consideration of many parameters including CO2 affinity, kinetics, energetics, stability, capture mechanism, in addition to cost. Here, we perform a systematic analysis regarding the key technical parameters that are required for the best CO2 capture performance using physical adsorbents. We also experimentally demonstrate a suitable material model of metal organic framework as advanced adsorbents with unprecedented properties for CO2 capture in a wide range of CO2 concentration. These recently developed class of MOF adsorbents represent a breakthrough finding in the removal of traces CO2 using physical adsorption. This platform shows colossal tuning potential for more efficient separation agents and guide researchers on the crucial criteria to be considered in the development of adsorbents for traces and low concentration CO2 capture.

TI Analysis of measures and potentials for energy-related renovation of
   residential buildings today and in 2050
SO BAUPHYSIK
LA German
DT Article
AB This study examines different restructuring measures for reference residential buildings in Germany. The subjects of the investigation are the calculated net, final and primary energy demand as well as the caused CO2 equivalent emissions and the resulting annuity. The purpose is to identify what kinds of measures have the biggest saving effects concerning the above-named parameters. There-for the German residential building stock is represented by nine reference buildings, ranging from single-to large multi-family homes. By the definition of four different building refurbishment levels, the characteristics of non-renovated buildings up to fully renovated buildings are taken into account. Remediation measures such as the building refurbishment or the decarbonisation of the heat generation are evaluated individually or combined. For the assessment of the whole residential building sector a building-quantity structure is developed. Lastly five different scenarios portraying the residential building sector in 2050 are evaluated with respect to the resulting final and primary energy demand as well as the caused CO2 equivalent emissions.

AB The block type and structural systems in buildings affect the amount of building materials required as well as the CO2 emissions that occur throughout the building life cycle (LCCO2). The purpose of this study was to assess the life cycle CO2 emissions when an apartment housing with 'flat-type' blocks (the reference case) was replaced with more sustainable 'T-type' blocks with fewer CO2 emissions (the alternative case) maintaining the same total floor area. The quantity of building materials used and building energy simulations were analyzed for each block type using building information modeling techniques, and improvements in LCCO2 emission were calculated by considering high-strength concrete alternatives. By changing the bearing wall system of the 'flat-type' block to the 'column and beam' system of the 'T-type' block, LCCO2 emissions of the alternative case were 4299 kg-CO2/m(2), of which 26% was at the construction stage, 73% was as the operational stage and 1% was at the dismantling and disposal stage.

TI On-Site Measurements of CO2 Emissions during the Construction

SO ENERGIES
LA English
DT Article
DE CO2 emission; building construction; energy consumption
ID LIFE-CYCLE; ENERGY USE; CONCRETE; WOOD
AB This study describes the environmental impact of the material production, transportation, and construction phases from the construction site perspective. CO2 emissions for each process were determined using the Korea Life Cycle Inventory Database (LCI DB) in the material production phase, and the actual amounts of oil consumption for transportation equipment were identified in the material transportation phase. Generally, the oil and electric energy consumed during the construction was evaluated by direct monitoring. Through the construction period and cost according to work type, a correlation with CO2 emissions was also investigated. In addition, CO2 emissions were examined through the system capacity and gross floor area for each work type. The calculations have shown that CO2 emissions from the material production phase constitute 93.4% of the total CO2 emissions. In addition, CO2 emissions from the material transportation and on-site construction account for 2.4% and 4.2% of the total CO2 emissions, respectively. This paper concludes that it is important to select appropriate input materials and resources for the reduction of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the amount of CO2 emissions arising from the construction site was reduced by finding and practicing measures to reduce CO2 emissions for each process.

AB Along with China's rapid industrialization and urbanization, challenges in reducing pollution and CO2 emissions are increasing. One of the major approaches to coordinate economic growth and environmental protection is to substitute coal-fired power with renewable energy. Since 2003, in order to promote wind power development, China has put in place many support policies which fall into either price policy category or non-price policy category. By using a variable intercept and mixed regression model with provincial panel data during 2001-2013, we analyzed the impacts of both categories on the increase of installed capacity in areas with different wind resources. We found that price policy and two non-price policies had positive impacts on the increase of wind power installation, price policy played a greater role than non-price policy did in promoting wind power development, and price policy was more effective in areas with poor wind resources, whilst non-price policy was more effective in areas with rich wind resources. Built on these findings, conclusions and policy recommendations are provided at the end of the paper. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of fossil energy need to be reduced to combat global climate change. For zero energy and Zero Emission Buildings (ZEB), photovoltaic solar energy systems are often installed. When the goal is to build a life cycle Zero Emission Building, all emissions come under scrutiny. Emissions from photovoltaic (PV) energy systems in Zero Emission Buildings have been shown to have a relative large share of material emissions. In this paper, we compare GHG emissions per kW h of electricity and greenhouse gas emission payback times (GPBT) for three residential PV systems in Zero Emission Pilot Buildings in Norway. All the buildings have roof mounted PV systems with different design solutions. The objective is to analyse the emission loads and GPBT of these three systems to facilitate for more informed choices of energy systems for Zero Emission Buildings. The results show that the total embodied emissions allocated per square meter of module area are around 150-350 kg CO2 eq/m(2) for the three different systems. Emissions from the mounting systems vary from 10 to 25 kg CO2 eq/m(2) depending on the material types and quantities used. When modules replace other roofing materials, such as roof tiles, mounting emissions were reduced by approximately 60%. GHG emissions per kW h electricity produced were in the range of 30-120 g CO2 eq/kW h for the different systems. The system with the lowest emissions was the largest system, which had a simple mounting structure and modules with reused cells. It was found that the GPBT was strongly dependent on the scenario used for electricity grid emissions. By applying a dynamic emission payback scenario with an optimistic reduction of emissions from the European electricity grid, the GPBT was 3-8 years for the different systems. When comparing the emissions with current Norwegian hydropower emissions, of around 20 g CO2 eq/kW h, it was found that all of the PV system's emissions were higher. When compared to a mainly fossil fuel based grid, all the PV system's emissions are low. This study highlights the importance of reliable emission documentation for PV modules and their mounting structures on the market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to develop an evaluation process for comparing the energy performances of Green and non-Green buildings. The information on the building attributes and energy consumption of 455 multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs) in 2014, including 321 non-certified MFHCs and 126 MFHCs that accredited Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design (G-SEED) certification (an official Green Building certification in South Korea) and 8 MFHCs that accredited Leadership in Energy and Environmental Development (LEED) certification, were applied to the empirical study. Data-mining techniques are applied to develop the comparison groups considering various building attributes, and the database was classified into four groups based on the average enclosed area per household (AEA). It was shown that the large-AEA groups (i.e., Group 4, over 143.47 m(2)) had less energy use intensity (EUI) than the small-AEA groups (i.e., Group 1, under 97.04 m(2)). The mean of site EUI for Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were significantly different (125.29, 116.35, 110.89, and 101.00 kWh/m(2).y, respectively). While the G-SEED and LEED-certified MFHCs were considered to have up to 10 and 15% energy savings, respectively, compared to all non-certified MFHCs, the comparative analysis by the developed Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 revealed that the G-SEED-certified MFHCs and the non-certified MFHCs had no significant differences in energy performance. Therefore, the energy performance rating system of G-SEED should be revised. The proposed energy performance evaluation process can also be useful in identifying the energy performance of other buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With China's urbanization, issues relating to emission reduction of buildings have become more prominent. Based on the latest data, we estimate total area of China's buildings, total housing area, and residential elevator stock. And also, we estimate energy consumption and carbon emission from the fossil fuel during building operation phase. Two index decomposition analysis on changes of urban residential carbon emissions and emissions intensity have been applied. The major findings of the study are: firstly, there has been a significant shift from primary energy consumption to electricity and heat in urban residential during the periods of 1996-2012, and the proportion of direct CO2 emission to residential emission declined. Secondly, residential energy intensity, per capita housing area, total number of households are the main driving factors affecting the change in carbon emissions, with contribution rates of -39%, 77%, 67% respectively, and the decline of energy intensity is the most important factor of decreasing carbon intensity (contribution rate of 89%). Thirdly, reduction of carbon intensity is conducive to the decline of CO2 and decrease in emission intensity of urban residential. Residential energy efficiency policy lessons learned from rethink of economic and social policies during the study period were concluded finally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A pilot project of the solar water heating system combined with a low temperature air source heat pump (ASHP) unit was established in 2014 in a detached residential house in the rural region of Beijing, in order to investigate the system application prospect for single family houses via system optimization design and economic analysis. The established system was comprised of the glass heat-pipe based evacuated tube solar collectors with a gross area of 18.8 m(2) and an ASHP with a stated heating power of 8 kW for the space heating of a single family rural house of 81.4 m(2). The dynamic thermal performance of the pilot system was measured for continuous 20 days under typical cold climate conditions and the test data was used to validate the TRNSYS simulation model established. On the basis of model validation, system optimizations of both the existing pilot household and the typical rural house with good building insulation were undertaken to figure out the system economical efficiency in the rural regions of Beijing. The results show that the payback periods of the solar space heating system combined with the ASHP with the collector areas 15.04-22.56 m(2) are 173-22.4 years for the established pilot household on the current electricity price level of 0.5 RMB/kWh, comparing with the reference condition of the fully ASHP space heating. It is further found that the equivalent solar heat price per kWh is too high under the current solar market cost price and collector technology. To put forward the integrated solar space heating for reducing carbon emission, it is suggested that the Beijing municipal government should offer some financial subsidy to compensate the equivalent solar heat price per kWh.

TI Impacts of Dams and Global Warming on Fish Biodiversity in the
   Indo-Burma Hotspot

AB Both hydropower dams and global warming pose threats to freshwater fish diversity. While the extent of global warming may be reduced by a shift towards energy generation by large dams in order to reduce fossil-fuel use, such dams profoundly modify riverine habitats. Furthermore, the threats posed by dams and global warming will interact: for example, dams constrain range adjustments by fishes that might compensate for warming temperatures. Evaluation of their combined or synergistic effects is thus essential for adequate assessment of the consequences of planned water-resource developments. We made projections of the responses of 363 fish species within the Indo-Burma global biodiversity hotspot to the separate and joint impacts of dams and global warming. The hotspot encompasses the Lower Mekong Basin, which is the world's largest freshwater capture fishery. Projections for 81 dam-building scenarios revealed progressive impacts upon projected species richness, habitable area, and the proportion of threatened species as generating capacity increased. Projections from 126 global-warming scenarios included a rise in species richness, a reduction in habitable area, and an increase in the proportion of threatened species; however, there was substantial variation in the extent of these changes among warming projections. Projections from scenarios that combined the effects of dams and global warming were derived either by simply adding the two threats, or by combining them in a synergistic manner that took account of the likelihood that habitat shifts under global warming would be constrained by river fragmentation. Impacts on fish diversity under the synergistic projections were 10-20% higher than those attributable to additive scenarios, and were exacerbated as generating capacity increased-particularly if CO2 emissions remained high. The impacts of dams, especially those on river mainstreams, are likely to be greater, more predictable and more immediately pressing for fishes than the consequences of global warming. Limits upon dam construction should therefore be a priority action for conserving fish biodiversity in the Indo-Burma hotspot. This would minimize synergistic impacts attributable to dams plus global warming, and help ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services represented by the Lower Mekong fishery.

TI Life cycle production and costs of a residential solar hot water and
   grid-connected photovoltaic system in humid subtropical Texas
SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY
AB Hot and humid climates with high solar radiation have the potential to offset residential building energy consumption with the application of solar hot water and photovoltaic electricity generation. However, costs, lack of incentives for the systems, and the need for proof-of-concepts continue to limit market penetration. The surplus of natural gas in certain areas of the United States, particularly Texas, continues to keep gas and electricity production economical compared to solar alternatives. However, trends that demand lower energy homes, a desire for local energy independence, and the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions continue to fuel solar energy systems penetration. To support solar use, this research was performed to evaluate and analyze the real-world life cycle energy and costs of a solar photovoltaic and solar hot water system (SHWS) installed on a high-end residential home in Houston, TX (IECC Zone 2). The house was a well-insulated, large urban home with two renewable energy systems installed: a 3.5kW solar photovoltaic system (SPVS) and a 1.71kW solar hot water system. Analyses were part of a larger study performed to investigate the contributions of the solar energy off-sets on the operational energy of the building over a life cycle period of 30-years. Field measurements of energy production were compared to solar energy simulations based on the typical meteorological year and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) data. NSRDB provided the basis for a probabilistic interpretation of annual energy production in terms of probability measures, P50/P90. It was found that field estimates were within simulation uncertainties and P90 predictions were within 2.5% of TMY3 (typical meteorological year data 3) results for both the solar photovoltaic system (SPVS) and solar hot water system (SHWS). Additionally, optimizations in the system design and life cycle costs were investigated to determine the annual optimal performance for the solar energy systems. The SHWS was installed at a less than optimum azimuth of 270 degrees instead of 180 degrees (corresponding to a 16% reduction in annual output). The SPVS was installed at optimal design conditions of 180 degrees azimuth and 42 degrees tilt. Payback and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) could have been minimized with the addition of another solar hot water collector with a minimal impact to overall cost. Cost sensitivity analysis on the LCOE and net-present value (NPV) were also performed and over a 30-year life cycle period, TMY3 based simulations predicted a NPV of $ 796 (21.8-year non-discounted payback) and -$ 1246 (29.2-year non-discounted payback) for the SHWS and SPVS, respectively. The SHWS achieved a LCOE of 8.1 (sic)/kWh, while the value for the SPVS was 12.29 (sic)/kWh. For the SPVS, the photovoltaic module and collector costs were the largest life cycle costs, and of special note, a reduction in the module cost by 67% reduces the LCOE to the market average-high electricity price of 10 (sic)/kWh. Finally, the combined renewable energy systems generated an estimated 30-year life-cycle energy production of 184 814 kWh, with auxiliary gas provided for supplemental hot-water heating. On average, a Texas residential home utilizes 420 000 kWh of electrical energy, 19% of which is domestic hot water demand. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB A technical feasibility study of an innovative hybrid solar-wind-rain eco-roof system with natural ventilation and skylight for electrical energy generation and saving is presented in this paper. The system integrates and optimizes five green technologies: wind turbine, solar photovoltaic system, rain water harvesting and utilization system, natural ventilation and roof sky lighting. The design was conceptualized based on the experiences acquired from meteorological data for Malaysian application. The V-shape top roof which was designed above the wind turbine was able to increase the wind speed by the venturi effect before the wind interacts with the wind turbine located between the roofs, hence improve the performance of the wind turbine. An automatic cooling and cleaning system with a stream of water was designed to clean and cool the roof which can improve the electrical efficiency of the solar photovoltaic modules. The ventilation vents of the system allow warm air inside the building to be ventilated out from the building by the pressure difference caused by high speed wind due to the roof design. The skylighting in the system improve the living comfort level and reduce power consumption of artificial lighting. Technical assessment of the system showed the estimated annual energy generated was 21205.65 kWh, estimated energy savings was 1839.6 kWh, the estimated annual ventilation rate was 2.17 x 10(8) m(3) and reduction of CO2 emissions was 17767.89 kg/yr.

AB This paper presents a model which estimates current car fleet energy consumption in Andorra and forecasts such consumption as a reference scenario. The base-year model is built through a bottom-up methodology using vehicle registration and technical inspection data. The model forecasts energy consumption up to 2050, taking into account the fleet structure, the car survival profile, trends in activity of the various car categories, and the fuel price and income elasticities that affect car stock and total fleet activity. It provides an initial estimate of private car energy demand in Andorra and charts a baseline scenario that describes a hypothetical future based on historical trends. A local sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the most sensitive input parameters and study the effect of its variability. In addition, the scenario analysis explores the most uncertain future aspects which can cause important variability in the results with respect to the Reference scenario and provides a broad estimate of potential energy savings related to different policy strategies.

AB Residential and commercial buildings comprise approximately forty percent of total energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. Yet, while California spends $1.5 billion annually on energy efficiency programs, limited research has explored how building energy consumption varies within cities, including the social and structural factors that influence electricity and natural gas use. We present results from an analysis of aggregated account-level utility billing data for energy consumption across the over two million properties in Los Angeles County. Results show that consumption in L.A. County varies widely with geography, income, building characteristics, and climate. Several higher-income areas have greater total energy use per building even in cooler climates, while many lower-income regions rank higher for energy use per square-foot. Energy consumption also correlates with building age, which varies widely throughout the region. Our results demonstrate the many complex and interrelated factors that influence urban energy use. While billing data is critical for devising energy efficiency programs that actually realize estimated savings and promote more sustainable cities, opening access to such data presents significant challenges for protecting personal privacy. The presented approach is adaptable and scalable to cities seeking to develop data-driven policies to reduce building energy use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an innovative and holistic approach to the analysis of the impact of selected design parameters of a new solar community on its environmental performance, in terms of energy efficiency and carbon footprint (green-house gas (GHG) emissions). The design parameters include energy performance level of buildings, density, type of the neighborhood (mixed-use vs residential), location of the commercial center relative to residential areas and the design of the streets. Energy performance is measured as the balance between overall energy consumption for building operations (assuming an all electric neighborhood) and electricity generation potential through integration of PV panels on available roof surfaces. Greenhouse gas emissions are those associated with building operations and transport.
   Results of simulations carried out on prototype neighborhoods located in the vicinity of Calgary, Alberta, Canada indicate that, while adopting high-energy efficiency measures can reduce the buildings' impact by up to 75% in terms of energy consumption and GHG emissions, transport still has a large environmental impact. The parameters of highest impact on transport and its associated GHG emissions are the design of the neighborhood and the distance to the business center. Density, as isolated parameter, has a modest effect on the selected mode of transportation, in terms of using private or public transportation.
   While this study relates to a specific location and a range of design assumptions, the methodology employed can serve as a template for evaluating design alternatives of new sustainable developments and their environmental impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Benchmarks are required to determine the environmental performance of new buildings. Through LCA, this study assessed the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings in South Korea. By conducting statistical analysis (Pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and Mann-Whitney test), gross floor area, latitude, and longitude were influence factors which cause the differences in environmental impacts among buildings. The differences in environmental impacts by gross floor area can be considered by defining the functional unit as one square meter of floor area. The differences in environmental impacts by region can be considered after dividing 23 elementary school buildings according to latitude and longitude. Based on the results of the two-step cluster analysis and the Mann-Whitney test on latitude and longitude, the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings were divided into two clusters, with the exception of human carcinogenic potential and human non-carcinogenic potential. Therefore, this study presented the benchmarks in two clusters. For instance, the benchmarks for global warming potential in Clusters One and Two were 3.70E+03 and 2.53E+03 kg-CO2 eq./m(2), respectively. The benchmark for the human carcinogenic potential was 8.63E-08 cases(can)/m(2). The benchmarks are expected to be used in deterinining the environmental performance of new elementary school buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents experimental study of diesel engine heat pump (DEHP) system to find potential as retrofit technology in off-gas or weak electricity network area to replace existing gas/oil/electric heating system in domestic sector. Test set-up of diesel engine driven water-to-water heat pump system was built which included heat recovery arrangement from the engine coolant & exhaust gas. The system was designed to meet typical house heating demand in Northern Ireland. Performance of DEHP was evaluated to meet house-heating demand at different flow temperature (35, 45, 55 & 65 degrees C), a typical requirement of underfloor space heating, medium/high temperature radiators and domestic hot water. The performance was evaluated against four-evaporator water inlet temperature (0, 5, 10 & 15 degrees C) and at three different engine speed 1600, 2000 & 2400 rpm. Experiment results were analysed in terms of heating/cooling capacity, heat recovery, total heat output, primary energy ratio (PER), isentropic efficiency, etc. Test results showed that DEHP is able to meet house-heating demand with help of heat recovery with reduced system size. Heat recovery contributed in a range of 22-39% in total heat output. It is possible to achieve high flow temperature in a range of 74 degrees C with help of heat recovery. Overall system PER varied in a range of 0.93-1.33. Speed increment and flow temperature has significant impact on heat recovery, total heat output and PER. A case scenario with different flow temperature to match house-heating demand has been presented to show working potential with different heat distribution system. In addition, DEHP shows good potential to save primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions, a helpful technology to achieve national emission reduction target. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Energy performance certificates are considered to be tools for knowledge and energy planning in the residential sector. Although energy performance certificates describe primary energy consumption and the associated emissions of a home or building, they do not consider the influence of building automation control systems (BACS) or technical building management (TBM) systems on these parameters. The European Standard EN 15232 remedies this shortcoming and evaluates the savings in primary energy and the reduction of CO2 emissions that can be achieved by these systems. This study investigates the energy performance certificates registered in the Autonomous Community of La Rioja and considers the policy changes in the Technical Building Code (codigo Tecnico de la Edificacion) and, specifically, the Basic Document for Energy Saving (Documento Basic de Ahorro de Energia) (CTE-DB-HE). Due to this regulatory change, we corrected the certificates and outlined different scenarios based on the implementation of these systems in this study. These scenarios show the potential distribution of energy performance certificates and the improvements in the ratings obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
